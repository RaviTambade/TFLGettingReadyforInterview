<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">1. Why do we use API in cloud computing environment? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Application Programming Interfaces (API) is used in cloud computing environment for accessing many services. APIs are very easy to use. They 
provide a quick option to create different set of applications in cloud environment.</p>
<p>An API provides a simple interface that can be used in multiple scenarios. </p>
<p> There are different types of clients for cloud computing APIs. It is easier to serve different needs of multiple clients with APIs in cloud computing environment.
 </p>



<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">2. What are the different areas of Security Management in cloud?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Different areas of Security management in cloud are as folows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>I. Identity Management : </b>This aspect creates dif erent level of users, roles and their credentials to access the services in cloud. </li>
        <li><b>II. Access Control : </b>In this area, we create multiple levels of permissions and access areas that can be given to a user or role for 
accessing a service in cloud environment. </li>
        <li><b>III. Authentication :</b> In this area, we check the credentials of a user and confirm that it is the correct user. Generaly this is done by 
user password and multi-factor authentication like-verification by a one-time use code on cel phone. </li>
        <li><b>IV. Authorization :</b> In this aspect, we check for the permissions that are given to a user or role. If a user is authorized to access a 
service, they are alowed to use it in the cloud environment.</li>
    </ol>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">3. What are the main cost factors of cloud based data center?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Costs in a Cloud based data center are different from a traditional data center. Main cost factors of cloud based data center are as follows: </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>I. Labor cost :</b> We need skilled staff that can work with the cloud-based datacenter that we have selected for our operation. Since 
cloud is not a very old technology, it may get difficult to get the right skil people for handling cloud based datacenter. </li>
        <li><b>II. Power cost :</b> In some cloud operations, power costs are borne by the client. Since it is a variable cost, it can increase with the 
increase in scale and usage. </li>
        <li><b>III. Computing cost : </b>The biggest cost in Cloud environment is the cost that we pay to Cloud provider for giving us computing 
resources. This cost is much higher compared to the labor or power costs. </li>
    </ol>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">4. How can we measure the cloud-based services?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>
In a cloud-computing environment we pay for the services that we use. So main criteria to measure a cloud based service its usage.  </p>
   <p>For computing resource we measure by usage in terms of time and the power of computing resource.  </p>
<p>For a storage resource we measure by usage in terms of bytes (giga bytes) and bandwidth used in data transfer. </p>

<p> Another important aspect of measuring a cloud service is its availability. A cloud provider has to specify the service level agreement (SLA) for the 
time for which service wil be available in cloud. </p>
    


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">5. How a traditional datacenter is different from a cloud environment?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>In a traditional datacenter the cost of increasing the scale of computing environment is much higher than a Cloud computing environment. Also in a 
traditional data center, there are not much benefits of scaling down the operation when demand decreases. Since most of the expenditure is in 
capital spent of buying servers etc., scaling down just saves power cost, which is very less compared to other fixed costs.   </p>
   <p> 
Also in a Cloud environment there is no need to higher a large number of operations staf to maintain the datacenter. Cloud provider takes care of 
maintaining and upgrading the resources in Cloud environment. </p>
<p>With a traditional datacenter, people cost is very high since we have to hire a large number of technical operation people for in-house datacenter. </p>
    


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">6. How will you optimize availability of your application in a Cloud environment? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p> 
In a Cloud environment, it is important to optimize the availability of an application by implementing disaster recovery strategy. For disaster 
recovery we create a backup application in another location of cloud environment. In case of complete failure at a data center we use the disaster 
recovery site to run the application.   </p>
   <p> 
Another aspect of cloud environment is that servers often fail or go down. In such a scenario it is important to implement the application in such a 
way that we just kil the slow server and restart another server to handle the traffic seamlessly. </p>



<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">7. What are the requirements for implementing IaaS strategy in Cloud?  </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Main requirements to implement IAAS are as folows:  </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>I. Operating System(OS):</b> We need an OS to support hypervisor in IaaS. We can use open source OS like Linux for this purpose.  </li>
        <li><b>II. Networking :</b> We have to define and implement networking topology for IaaS implementation. We can use public or private 
network for this. </li>
        <li><b>III. Cloud Model :</b> We have to select the right cloud model for implementing IaaS strategy. It can be SaaS, PaaS or CaaS. </li>
    </ol>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">8. What is the scenario in which public cloud is preferred over private cloud?  </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p> In a startup mode often we want to test our idea. In such a scenario it makes sense to setup application in public cloud. It is much faster and 
cheaper to use public cloud over private cloud.  </p>
  <p> Remember security is a major concern in public cloud. But with time and changes in technology, even public cloud is very secure.  </p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">9. Do you think Cloud Computing is a software application or a hardware service? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p> Cloud Computing is neither a software application nor a hardware service. Cloud computing is a systemarchitecture that can be used to implement 
software as wel as hardware strategy of an organization.  </p>
  <p>Cloud Computing is a highly scalable, highly available and cost ef ective solution for software and hardware needs of an application. </p>
  <p>Cloud Computing provides great ease of use in running the software in cloud environment. It is also very fast to implement compared with any 
other traditional strategy.</p>
    


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">10. Why companies now prefer Cloud Computing architecture over Client Server Architecture?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>  
In Client Server architecture there is one to one communication between client and server. Server is often at in-house datacenter and client can 
access same server from anywhere. If client is at a remote location, the communication can have high latency.  </p>
  <p>In Cloud Computing there can be multiple servers in the cloud. There wil be a Cloud controler that directs the requests to right server node. In 
such a scenario clients can access cloud-based service from any location and they can be directed to the one nearest to them. </p>
  <p>Another reason for Cloud computing architecture is high availability. Since there are multiple servers behind the cloud, even if one server is down, 
another server can serve the clients seamlessly.</p>
    


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">11. What are the main characteristics of Cloud Computing architecture?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Main characteristics of Cloud Computing architecture are as folows:  </p>
  <ol>
        <li><b>I. Elasticity : </b>In Cloud Computing system is highly elastic in the sense that it can easily adapt itself to increase or decrease in load. 
There is no need to take urgent actions when there is surge in traf ic requests.</li>
        <li><b>II. Self-service provisioning :</b> In Cloud environment users can provision new resources on their own by just caling some APIs. 
There is no need to fill forms and order actual hardware from vendors.</li>
        <li><b>III. Automated de-provisioning :</b> In case demand/load decreases, extra resources can be automatically shut down in Cloud 
computing environment.</li>
        <li><b>IV. Standard Interface :</b> There are standard interfaces to start, stop, suspend or remove an instance in Cloud environment. Most of 
the services are accessible via public and standard APIs in Cloud computing. </li>
        <li><b>V. Usage based Billing : </b>In a Cloud environment, users are charged for their usage of resources. They can forecast their bil and 
costs based on the growth they are expecting in their load. </li>
    </ol>



<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">12. How databases in Cloud computing are different from traditional databases? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p> In a Cloud environment, companies often use dif erent kind of data to store. There are data like email, images, video, pdf, graph etc. in a Cloud 
environment. To store this data often NoSQL databases are used.   </p>
  <p>A NoSQL database like MongoDB provides storage and retrieval of data that cannot be stored ef iciently in a traditional RDBMS.  </p>
  <p> Database like Neo4J provides features to store graph data like Facebook, LinkedIn etc. in a cloud environment.</p>
<p>  
Hadoop like database help in storing Big Data based information. It can handle very large-scale information that is generated in a large-scale 
environment. </p>  



<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">13. What is Virtual Private Network (VPN)?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>  In a Cloud environment, we can create a virtual private network (VPM) that can be solely used by only one client. This is a secure network in 
which data transfer between servers of same VPN is very secure.  </p>
  <p>By using VPN, an organization uses the public network in a private manner. It increases the privacy of an organization’s data transfer in a cloud 
environment.  </p>
  


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">14. What are the main components of a VPN?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Virtual Private Network (VPN) consists of following main components:  </p>
  <ol>
        <li><b> Network Access Server (NAS): </b>A NAS server is responsible for setting up tunnels in a VPN that is accesses remotely. It 
maintains these tunnels that connect clients to VPN. </li>
        <li><b> Firewall :</b> It is the software that creates barrier between VPN and public network. It protects the VPN from malicious activity that can be done from the outside network.</li>
        <li><b>AAA Server : </b>This is an authentication and authorization server that controls the access and usage of VPN. For each request to use VPN, AAA server checks the user for correct permissions</li>
        <li><b>Encryption : </b>In a VPN, encryption algorithms protect the important private data from malicious users. </li>
    </ol>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">15. How will you secure the application data for transport in a cloud environment?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p> With ease of use in Cloud environment comes the important aspect of keeping data secure. Many organizations have data that is transferred from 
their traditional datacenter to Cloud datacenter.  </p>
  <p>During the transit of data it is important to keep it secure. Once of the best way to secure data is by using HTTPS protocol over Secure Socket 
Layer (SSL).</p>
<p>Another important point is to keep the data always encrypted. This protects data from being accessed by any unauthorized user during transit. </p>



<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">16. What are the large-scale databases available in Cloud? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p> 
In Cloud computing scale is not a limit. So there are very large-scale databases available from cloud providers. Some of these are:  </p>
  <ol>
        <li><b>I. Amazon DynamoDB :</b> Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a NoSQL web service caled DynamoDB that provides highly 
available and partition tolerant database system. It has a multi-master design. It uses synchronous replication across multiple 
datacenters. We can easily integrate it with MapReduce and Elastic MapReduce of AWS. </li>
        <li><b>II. Google Bigtable :</b> This is a very large-scale high performance cloud based database option from Google. It is available on Google 
Cloud. It can be scaled to peta bytes. It is a Google proprietary implementation. In Bigtable, two arbitrary string values, row key 
and column key, and timestamp are mapped to an arbitrary byte array. In Bigtable MapReduce algorithm is used for modifying and 
generating the data. </li>
        <li><b>III. Microsoft Azure SQL Database :</b> Microsoft Azure provides cloud based SQL database that can be scaled very easily for 
increased demand. It has very good security features and it can be even used to build multi-tenant apps to service multiple 
customers in cloud. </li>
    </ol>

It provides high performance and always-on user experience.</li>
    </ol>



<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">18. What are the important points to consider before selecting cloud computing? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p> Cloud computing is a very good option for an organization to scale and outsource its software/hardware needs. But before selecting a cloud 
provider it is important to consider following points:   </p>
  <ol>
        <li><b>I. Security : </b>One of the most important points is security of the data. We should ask the cloud provider about the options to keep 
data secure in cloud during transit and at rest. </li>
        <li><b>II. Data Integrity : </b>Another important point is to maintain the integrity of data in cloud. It is essential to keep data accurate and 
complete in cloud environment.  </li>
        <li><b>III. Data Loss :</b> In a cloud environment, there are chances of data loss. So we should know the provisions to minimize the data loss. It 
can be done by keeping backup of data in cloud. Also there should be reliable data recovery options in case of data loss.  </li>
<li><b>IV. Compliance :</b> While using a cloud environment one must be aware of the rules and regulations that have to be followed to use the 
cloud. There compliance issues with storing data of a user in an external provider’s location/servers.</li>
<li><b>V. Business Continuity :</b> In case of any disaster, it is important to create business continuity plans so that we can provide 
uninterrupted service to our end users.</li>
<li><b>VI. Availability :</b> Another important point is the availability of data and services in a cloud-computing environment. It is very important 
to provide high availability for a good customer experience.</li>
<li><b>VII. Storage Cost :</b> Since data is stored in cloud, it may be very cheap to store the data. But the real cost can come in transfer of data 
when we have to pay by bandwidth usage. So storage cost of data in cloud should also include the access cost of data transfer.</li>
<li><b>VIII. Computing Cost :</b> One of the highest costs of cloud is computing cost. It can be very high cost with the increase of scale. So 
cloud computing options should be wisely considered in conjunction with computing cost charged for them.</li>
    </ol>

  <p>Often an organization does not know al the options available in a Cloud computing environment. Here comes the role of a SystemIntegrator (SI) who specializes in implementing Cloud computing environment.</p>
  <p>SI creates the strategy of cloud setup. It designs the cloud platform for the use of its client. It creates the cloud architecture for the business need of client.</p>
  <p>SI oversees the overall implementation of cloud strategy and plan. It also guides the client while choosing the right options in cloud computing platform.</p>



<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">20.  What is virtualization in cloud computing?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Virtualization is the core of cloud computing platform. In cloud we can create a virtual version of hardware, storage and operating system that can be used to deploy the application.</p>
  <p>A cloud provider gives options to create virtual machines in cloud that can be used by its clients. These virtual machines are much cheaper than buying a few high end computing machines.</p>
  <p>In cloud we can use multiple cheap virtual machines to implement a resilient software system that can be scaled very easily in quick time. Where as buying an actual high-end machine to scale the system is very costly and time taking.
</p>

  <p>Utility computing is a cloud service model in which provider gives computing resources to users for using on need basis.</p>
  <p>Some of the main benefits of Utility computing are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Pay per use</b>:  Since a user pays for only usage, the cost of Utility computing is pay per use. We pay for the number of servers of instances that we use in cloud.</li>
        <li><b>Easy to Scale </b>:  It is easier to scale up the operations in Utility computing. There is no need to plan for time consuming and costly hardware purchase</li>
        <li><b>Maintenance </b>:In Utility computing maintenance of servers is done by cloud provider. So a user can focus on its core business. It need not spend time and resources on maintenance of servers in cloud.Utility computing is also known as On-demand computing.</li>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">25. What is a Hypervisor in Cloud Computing?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Hypervisor is also known as virtual machine monitor (VMM). It is a computer software/hardware that can create and run virtual machines.</p>
  <p>Hypervisor runs on a host machine. Each virtual machine is called Guest machine</p>
  <p>Hypervisor derives its name from term supervisor, which is a traditional name for the kernel of an operating system</p>
  <p>Hypervisor provides a virtual operating platformto the guest operating system. It manages the execution of guest OS.</p>  


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">26. What are the different types of Hypervisor in Cloud Computing?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Hypervisors come in two main types:</p>
  <ol>
        <li><b>. Type-1, native orbare-metal hypervisors</b>: Type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the hardware of host machine. It controls the guest operating system from host machine. It is also caled bare metal hypervisor or native hypervisor.
        <p>Examples of Type-1 are:Xen, Oracle VM Server for SPARC, Oracle VM Server for x86, the CitrixXenServer, Microsoft Hyper-Vand VMware ESX/ESXi.</P></li>
        <li><b>Type-2, hosted hypervisors: </b>:  Type 2 hypervisor runs like a regular computer program on an operating system. The guest operating system runs like a process on the host machine. It creates an abstract guest operating systemif erent from the host operating system.<p>Examples of Type-2 are:VMware Workstation, VMware Player, VirtualBox, Paralels Desktop for Mac and QEMU are examples of type-2 hypervisors.</P>
        </li>
    </ol>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">30. Why automation of deployment is very important in Cloud architecture?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>One of the main reasons for selecting Cloud architecture is scalability of the system. In case of heavy load, we have to scale up the system so that there is no performance degradation.</p>
  <p>While scaling up the system we have to start new instances. To provision new instances we have to deploy our application on them.</p>
  <p>In such a scenario, if we want to save time, it makes sense to automate the deployment process. Another term for this is Auto-scaling</p>
  <p>With a fully automated deployment process we can start new instances based on automated triggers that are raised by load reaching a threshold.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">36. How will you optimize the Cloud Computing environment?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>In a Cloud Computing environment we pay by usage. In such a scenario our usage costs are much higher. To optimize the Cloud Computing environment we have to keep abalance between our usage costs and usage.</p>
  <p>If we are paying for computing instances we can choose options like Lambda in AWS, which is a much cheaper options for computing in cloud.</p>
  <p>In case of Storage, if the data to be stored is not going to be accesses frequently we can go for Glacier option in AWS.</p>
  <p>Similarly when we pay for bandwidth usage, it makes sense to implement a caching strategy so that we use less bandwidth for the content that is accessed very frequently.</p> 
<p>It is a chalenging task for an architect in cloud to match the options available in cloud with the budget that an organization has to run its applications.</p>
<p>Optimizations like server-less computing, load balancing, and storage selection can help in keeping the Cloud computing costs low with no degradation inUser experience.

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">37.Do you think Regulations and Legal Compliance is an important aspect of Cloud Computing?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Yes,in Cloud Computing we are using resources that are owned by the Cloud provider. Due to this our data resides on the servers that can be shared by other users of Cloud.</p>
  <p>There are regulations and laws for handling user data. We have to ensure that these regulations are met while selecting and implementing a Cloud computing strategy.</p>
  <p>Similarly, if we are in a contract with a client to provide certain Service Level Agreement (SLA) performance, we have to implement the cloud solutionin such a way that there is no breach of SLA agreement due to Cloud provider’s failures.</p>
  <p>For security there are laws that have to be folowed irrespective of Cloud or Co-located Data center. This is in the interest of our end-customer as wel as for the benefit of business continuity.</p>
  <p>With Cloud computing architecture we have to do due diligence in selecting Security and Encryption options in Cloud.</p>
