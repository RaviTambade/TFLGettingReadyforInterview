<p>A database is a collection of organised or arranged data that can be easily accessed, updated/ modified or controlled. Information within the database can be easily placed into rows and columns, or tables. Meanwhile, database management enables the user to store, manage and access data. Knowing the definitions and the difference between relational database management system and database management system will help candidates to prepare well.</p>

<p>Database Management System (DBMS) is software used to identify, manage, and create a database that provides administered access to the data. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a more advanced version of a DBMS system that allows access to data in a more efficient way. It is used to store or manage only the data that are in the form of tables.</p>

  <p>GIT is a distributed version control system and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis to handle small and large projects with speed and efficiency.</p>

<a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">2. What is Distributed Control System? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>We work in our local machine and later we transfer the code to Centralized repository (GitHub). We donâ€™t need to connect to centralized repository to work.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">3. What is GIT version control? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>GIT version control allows you to track the history of a collection of files (code files).</i>
    <li>It supports creating different versions of file collection. Each version captures a snapshot of the files at a certain point of time and You can revert the collection of  files using the snapshot. (You can develop the code in different versions of java. and you can merge in Git)</i>
    <li>VCS allows you to switch between these versions. These versions are stored in a specific place, typically called as repository. (You can switch between different versions of java in between development process</i>
  </ul>
