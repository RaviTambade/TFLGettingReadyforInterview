<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">2.What are the main benefits of DevOps?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>DevOps is a very popular trend in Software Development. Some ofthe main benefits of DevOps are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> <b>Release Velocity</b> : DevOps practices help in increasing the release velocity. We can release code to production more often and with more confidence.</li>
        <li><b>Development Cycle</b> : With DevOps, the complete Development cycle from initial design to production deployment becomes shorter</li>
        <li><b>Deployment Rollback</b> : In DevOps, we plan for any failure in deployment rolback due to a bug in code or issue in production. This gives confidence in releasing feature without worrying about downtime for rolback.</li>
        <li><b>Defect Detection</b>: With DevOps approach, we can catch defects much earlier than releasing to production It improvesthe quality of the software</li>
        <li><b>Recovery from Failure</b> :In case of a failure, we can recover very fast with DevOps process.</li>
        <li><b>Collaboration</b>:With DevOps, colaboration between development and operations professionals increases.</lI>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">3.What is the typical DevOps workflow you use in your organization?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>The typical DevOps workflow in our organization is as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>We use Atlassian Jira for writing requirements and tracking tasks.</li>
        <li>Based on the Jira tasks, developers check in code into GIT version control system.</li>
        <li>The code checked into GIT is built by using Apache Maven.</li>
        <li>The build processis automated with Jenkins.</li>
        <li>Code built on Jenkins is sent to organizationâ€™s Artifactory.</li>
        <li>Jenkins automaticaly picks the libraries from Artifactory and deploys it to Production</li>
        <li>During Production deployment Docker images are used to deploy same code on multiple hosts.</li>
        <li>Once code is deployed to Production, we use Nagios to monitor the health of production servers.</lI>
        <li>Splunk based alerts inform us of any issues or exceptions in production.</li>
    </ol>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">4.How do you take DevOps approach with Amazon Web Services?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) provide many tools and features to deploy and manage applications in AWS. As per DevOps, we treat infrastructure as code. We mainly use folowing two services from AWS for DevOps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>CloudFormation</b> : We use AWS CloudFormation to create and deploy AWS resources by using templates. We can describe our dependencies and pass special parameters in these templates.  CloudFormation can read these templates and deploy the application and resources in AWS cloud.</li>
        <li><b>OpsWorks </b>: AWS provides another service called OpsWorks that is used for configuration management by utilizing Chef framework. We can automate server configuration, deployment and management by using OpsWorks. It helps in managing EC2 instances in AWS as wel as any on-premises servers.</li>
    </ol>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">5.How will you run a script automatically when a developer commits a change into GIT?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>GIT provides the feature to execute custom scripts when certain event occurs in GIT. This feature is caled hooks.</p>
  <p>We can write two types of hooks.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Client-side hooks</li>
        <li>Server-side hooks</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For this case, we can write a Client-side post-commit hook. This hook wil execute a custom script inwhich we can add the message and code that we want to run automaticaly with each commit.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">6.What are the main features of AWS OpsWorks Stacks?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Some of the main features of AWS OpsWorks Stacks are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Server Support:AWS OpsWorks Stacks we can automate operational tasks on any server in AWS as well as our own data center.</li>
        <li>Scalable Automation : We get automated scaling support with AWS OpsWorks Stacks. Each new instance in AWS can read configuration from OpsWorks. It can even respond to system events in same way as other instances do. </li>
        <li>The code checked into GIT is built by using Apache Maven.</li>
        <li>The build processis automated with Jenkins.</li>
        <li>Code built on Jenkins is sent to organizationâ€™s Artifactory.</li>
        <li>Jenkins automaticaly picks the libraries from Artifactory and deploys it to Production</li>
        <li>During Production deployment Docker images are used to deploy same code on multiple hosts.</li>

    </ol>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">7.How does CloudFormation work in AWS?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>AWS CloudFormation is used for deploying AWS resources.</p>
  <p>In CloudFormation, we have to first create a template for a resource. A template is a simple text file that contains information about a stack on AWS. A stack is a collection of AWS resourced that we want to deploy together in an AWS as a group</p>
  <p> Once the template is ready and submitted to AWS, CloudFormation wil create al the resources in the template. This helps in automation of building new environments in AWS</p>



<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">8.What is CICD in DevOps?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>CICD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. These are two different concepts that are complementary to each other.</p>
  <p><b>Continuous Integration (CI)</b> : In CI al the developer work is merged to main branch several times a day. This helps in reducing integration problems</p>
  <p>In CI we try to minimize the duration for which a branch remains checked out. A developer gets early feedback on the new code added to main repository by using CI.</p>   
  <p><b>Continuous Delivery (CD) </b>: In CD, a software team plans to deliver software in short cycles. They perform development,testing and release in such a short time that incremental changes can be easily delivered to production</p>
  <p>In CD, as a DevOps we create a repeatable deployment process that can help achieve the objective of Continuous Delivery.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">9.What are the best practices of Continuous Integration (CI)?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Some of the best practices of Continuous Integration (CI) are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Build Automation</b> : In CI, we create such a build environment that even with one command build can be triggered. This automation is done all the way up to deployment to Production environment.</li>
        <li><b>Main Code Repository</b> : In CI, we maintain a main branch in code repository that stores all the Production ready code. This is the branch that we can deploy to Production any time.</li>
        <li><b>Self-testing build</b> : Every build in CI should be self-tested. It means with every build there is a set of tests that runs to ensure that changes are of high quality.</li>
        <li> <b>Every day commits to baseline </b>: Developers will commit all of theirs changes to baseline every day. This ensures that there is no big pile up of code waiting for integration with the main repository for a long time.</li>
        <li><b>Build every commit to baseline</b> : With Automated Continuous Integration, every time a commit is made into baseline, a build is triggered. This helps in confirming that every change integrates correctly.</li>
        <li><b>Fast Build Process</b> : One of the requirements of CI is to keep the build process fast so that we can quickly identify any problem.</li>
        <li><b>Production like environment testing </b>:In CI, we maintain a production like environment also known as preproduction or staging environment, which is very close to Production  environment. We perform testing in this environment to check for any integration issues.</li>
        <li> <b>Publish Build Results</b> : We publish build results on a common site so that everyone can see these and take corrective actions.</lI>
        <li><b>Deployment Automation</b>:The deployment process is automated to the extent that in a build process we can add the step of deploying the code to a test environment. On this test environment all the stakeholders can access and test the latest deliver</li>
    </ol>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">10.What are the benefits of Continuous Integration (CI)?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>The benefits of Continuous Integration (CI) are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>CI makes the current build constantly available for testing, demo and release purpose</li>
        <li>With CI, developers write modular code that works wel with frequent code check-ins</li>
        <li>Incase of a unit test failure or bug, developer can easily revert back to the bug-free state ofthe code</li>
        <li>There is drastic reduction in chaos on release day with CI practices.</li>
        <li>With CI, we can detect Integration issues much earlier in the process.</li>
        <li>Automated testing is one very useful sideefect of implementing CI.</li>
        <li>Al the stakeholders including business partners can see the smal changes deployed into pre-production environment. This provides early feedback on the changes to software.</li>
        <li>Automated CI and testing generates metrics like code-coverage, code complexity that help in improving the development process.</li>
    </ol>

  <p>Puppet Enterprise is a DevOps software platform that is used for automation of infrastructure operations. It runs on Unix as well as on Windows.</p>
  <p>We can define system configuration by using Puppetâ€™s language or RubyDSL</p>
  <p>The system configuration described in Puppetâ€™s language can be distributed to a target system by using RESTAPI calls.</p>   

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">24.What is the architecture of Puppet?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Puppet is Open Source software. It is based on Client-server architecture. It is a Model Driven system. The client is also called Agent. And server is called Master.</p>
  <p>It has folowing architectural components:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Configuration Language :</b> Puppet provides a language that is used to configure Resources. We have to specify what Action has to be applied to which Resource.</br>The Action has three items for each Resource: type, title and list of attributes of a resource. Puppet code is written in Manifests files.</li>
        <li><b>Resource Abstraction :</b>We can create Resource Abstraction in Puppet so that we can configure resources on different platforms. Puppet agent uses a Facter for passing the information of an environment to Puppet server. In Facter we have information about IP, hostname, OS etc of the environment</li>
        <li><b>Transaction :</b>In Puppet, Agent sends Facter to Master server. Master sends back the catalog to Client. Agent applies any configuration changes to system. Once all changes are applied, the result is sent to Server</li>
    </ol>

  <p>We can use Puppet Enterprise for folowing scenarios:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Node Management :</b>We can manage a large number of nodes with Puppet.</li>
        <li><b>Code Management :</b>With Puppet we can define Infrastructure as code. We can review, deploy, and test the environment configuration for Development, Testing and Production environments.</li>
        <li><b>Reporting & Visualization :</b>: Puppet provides Graphical tools to visualize and see the exact status of infrastructure configuration.</li>
        <li><b>Provisioning Automation :</b>With Puppet we can automate deployment and creation of new servers and resources. So users and business can get their infrastructure requirements completed very fast with Puppet</li>
        <li><b>Orchestration :</b>For a large Cluster of nodes, we can orchestrate the complete process by using Puppet. It can follow the order in which we want to deploy the infrastructure environments.</li>
        <li><b>Automation of Configuration :</b>With Configuration automation, the chances of manual errors are reduced. The process becomes more reliable with this.</li>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">26.What is the use of Kubernetes?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>We use Kubernetes for automation of large-scale deployment of Containerized applications.</p>
  <p>It is an open source system based on concepts similar to Googleâ€™s deployment process of milions of containers.</p>
  <p>It can be used on cloud, on-premise datacenter and hybrid infrastructure.</p>  
  <p>In Kubernetes we can create a cluster of servers that are connected to work as a single unit. We can deploy a containerized application to all the servers in a cluster without specifying the machine name.</p>
  <p>We have to package applications in such a way that they do not depend on a specific host.</p> 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">27.What is the architecture of Kubernetes?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>The architecture of Kubernetes consists of following components:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Master :</b> There is a master node that is responsible for managing the cluster. Master performs folowing functions in a cluster.</li>
              <ol>
              <li>Scheduling Applications</li>
              <li>Maintaining desired state of applications </li>
              <li>Scaling applications </li>
              <li>Applying updates to applications</li>
              </ol>
        <li><b>Nodes :</b>A Node in Kubernetes is responsible for running an application. The Node can be a Virtual Machine or a Computer in the cluster. There is software called Kubelet on each node.This software is used for managing the node and communicating with the Master node in cluster.</li>
  <p>There is a Kubernetes API that is used by Nodes to communicate with the Master. When we deploy an application on Kubernetes, we request Master to start application containers on Nodes.</p>
    </ol>

  <p>In a Kubernetes cluster, there is a Deployment Controler. This controler monitors the instances created by Kubernetes in a cluster. Once a node or the machine hosting the node goes down, Deployment Controler will replace the node.</p>
  <p>It is a self-healing mechanism in Kubernetes to provide high availability of applications.</p>
  <p>Therefore in Kubernetes cluster, Kubernetes Deployment Controler is responsible for starting the instances as well as replacing the instances in case of a failure.</p>

  <p>In DevOps approach we release software with high frequency to production. We have to run tests to gain confidence on the quality of software deliverables.</p>
  <p>Running tests manualy is a time taking process. Therefore, we first prepare automation tests and then deliver software. This ensures that we catch any defects early in our process.</p>

  <p>Chaos Monkey is a concept made popular by Netflix. In Chaos Monkey, we intentionaly try to shut down the services or create failures. By failing one or more services, we test the reliability and recovery mechanism of the Production architecture.</p>
  <p>It checks whether our applications and deployment have survival strategy built into it or not.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">31.How do you perform Test Automation in DevOps?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>We use Jenkins to create automated flows to run Automation tests. The first part of test automation is to develop test strategy and test cases. Once automation test cases are ready for an application, we have to plug these into each Build run.In each Build we run Unit tests, Integration tests and Functional tests.</p>
  <p>With a Jenkins job, we can automate all these tasks. Once all the automated tests pass, we consider the build as green. This helps in deployment and release processes to build confidence on the application software.</p>

  <p>We need to select an Operating System (OS) to get a specific Virtual Machine (VM). VM provides full OS to an application for running in a virtualized environment.</p>
  <p>A Container uses APIs of an Operating System (OS) to provide runtime environment to an application</p>
   <p>A Container is very light weight in comparison witha VM.</p>
   <p>VM provides higher level of security compared to a Container.</p>
   <p>A Container just provides the APIs that are required by the application.</p>

     <p>Another concept in Serverless Architecture is to treat code as a service or Function as a Service (FAAS).
        We just write code that can be run on any environment or server without the need of specifying which server should be used to run this code.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">36.What are the main principles of DevOps?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>DevOps is different from Technical Operations. It has following main principles:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> <b>Incremental</b>:  In DevOps we aim to incrementaly release software to production. We do release 
         to production more often than Waterfall approach of one large release.</li>
        <li><b>Automated</b>: To enable use to make releases more often, we automate the operations from Code Check in to deployment in Production. </li>
        <li><b>Collaborative</b> : DevOps is not only responsibility of Operations team. It is a collaborative effort of Dev, QA,Release and DevOps teams. </li>
        <li><b>Iterative</b>:  DevOps is based on Iterative principle of using a process that is repeatable. But with each iteration we aim to make the process more ef ificient and better. </li>
        <li><b>Self-Service</b>: In DevOps, we automate things and give self-service options to other teams so that they are empowered to deliver the work in their domain. </li>
    </ol>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">37.Are you more Dev or more Ops? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>This is a tricky question. DevOps is a new concept and in any organization the maturity of DevOps varies from highly Operations oriented to highly DevOps oriented. In some projects teams are very mature and practice DevOps in it true form.In some projects, teams rely more on Operations team.</p>
  <p>As a DevOps person I give first priority to the needs of an organization and project. At some times I may have to perform a lot of operations work. But with each iteration, I aim to bring DevOps changes incrementally to an organization.</p>
  <p>Over time, organization/project starts seeing results of DevOps practices and embraces it fully.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">38.What is a REST service?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>REST is also known as Representational State Transfer. A REST service is a simple software functionality that is available over HTTP protocol. It is a lightweight service that is widely available due to the popularity of HTTP protocol. </p>
  <p>Since REST is lightweight; it has very good performance in a software system. It is also one of the foundations for creating highly scalable systems that provide a service to large number of clients.</p> 
  <p>Another key feature of a REST service is that as long as the interface is kept same, we can change the underlying implementation. E.g. Clients of REST service can keep calling the same service while we change the implementation from php to Java.</p>

  <p>Three Ways of DevOps refers to three basic principles of DevOps culture. These are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>The First Way: Systems Thinking</b> : : In this principle we see the DevOps as a flow of work from left to right. This is the time taken from Code check in to the feature being released to End customer. In DevOps culture we try to identify the bottlenecks in this.</li>
        <li><b>The Second Way: Feedback Loops</b>: Whenever there is an issue in production it is a feedback about the whole development and deployment process.We try to make the feedback loop more efficient so that teams can get the feedback much faster. It is a way of catching defect much earlier in process than it being reported by customer.</li>
        <li><b>The Third Way: Continuous Learning</b>:: We make use of first and second way principles to keep on making improvements in the overall process.This is the third principle in which over the time we make the process and our operations highly efficient, automated and error free by continuously improving them </li>
    </ol>

  <p>Security of a system is one of the most important goals for an organization. We use following ways to apply DevOps to security.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Automated Security Testing</b>:We automate and integrate Security testing techniques for Software 
        Penetration testing and Fuzz testing in software development process.</li>
        <li><b>Early Security Checks </b>: We ensure that teams know about the security concerns at the beginning of a project, rather than at the end of delivery. It is achieved by conducting Security trainings and knowledge sharing sessions.</li>
        <li><b>Standard Process </b>: At DevOps we try to follow standard deployment and development process that has already gone through security audits. This helps in minimizing the introduction of any new security loopholes due to change in the standard process. </li>
    </ol>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">41.What is Self-testing Code? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Self-testing Code is an important feature of DevOps culture. In DevOps culture, development team members are expected to write self-testing code. It means we have to write code along with the tests that can test this code.Once the test passes, we feel confident to release the code. </p>
  <p>If we get an issue in production, we first write an automation test to validate that the issue happens in current release. Once the issue in release code is fixed, we run the same test to validate that the defect is not there. With each release we keep running these tests so that the issue does not appear anymore. </p>
  <p>One of the techniques of writing Self-testing code is Test Driven Development (TDD).</p> 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">42.What is a Deployment Pipeline?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
 <p>A Deployment Pipeline is an important concept in Continuous Delivery. In Deployment Pipeline we break the build process into distinct stages. In each stage we get the feedback to move onto the next stage.</p> 
 <p>It is a collaborative effort between various groups involved in delivering software development. Often the first stage in Deployment Pipeline is compiling the code and converting into binaries.</p> 
 <p>After that we run the automated tests. Depending on the scenario, there are stages like performance testing, security check, usability testing etc in a Deployment Pipeline. </p>
 <p>In DevOps, our aim is to automate all the stages of Deployment Pipeline. With a smooth running Deployment Pipeline, we can achieve the goal of Continuous Delivery.<p>
