<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">1.What is the difference between a Container and a Virtual Machine?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>We need to select an Operating System (OS) to get a specific Virtual Machine (VM). VM provides full OS to an application for running in a virtualized environment.</p>
  <p>A Container uses APIs of an Operating System (OS) to provide runtime environment to an application</p>
   <p>A Container is very light weight in comparison witha VM.</p>
   <p>VM provides higher level of security compared to a Container.</p>
   <p>A Container just provides the APIs that are required by the application.</p>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">2.What is Serverless architecture?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
    <p>Serverless Architecture is a term that refers to following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> An Application that depends on a third-party service.</li>
        <li>An Application in which code is run on ephemeral containers.</li>
      </ol>
     <p>In AWS, Lambda is a popular service to implement Serverless architecture.</p>
     <p>Another concept in Serverless Architecture is to treat code as a service or Function as a Service (FAAS).
        We just write code that can be run on any environment or server without the need of specifying which server should be used to run this code.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">3.What are the main principles of DevOps? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>DevOps is different from Technical Operations. It has following main principles:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> <b>Incremental</b>:  In DevOps we aim to incrementaly release software to production. We do release 
         to production more often than Waterfall approach of one large release.</li>
        <li><b>Automated</b>: To enable use to make releases more often, we automate the operations from Code Check in to deployment in Production. </li>
        <li><b>Collaborative</b> : DevOps is not only responsibility of Operations team. It is a collaborative effort of Dev, QA,Release and DevOps teams. </li>
        <li><b>Iterative</b>:  DevOps is based on Iterative principle of using a process that is repeatable. But with each iteration we aim to make the process more ef ificient and better. </li>
        <li><b>Self-Service</b>: In DevOps, we automate things and give self-service options to other teams so that they are empowered to deliver the work in their domain. </li>
    </ol>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">4.Are you more Dev or more Ops? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>This is a tricky question. DevOps is a new concept and in any organization the maturity of DevOps varies from highly Operations oriented to highly DevOps oriented. In some projects teams are very mature and practice DevOps in it true form.In some projects, teams rely more on Operations team.</p>
  <p>As a DevOps person I give first priority to the needs of an organization and project. At some times I may have to perform a lot of operations work. But with each iteration, I aim to bring DevOps changes incrementally to an organization.</p>
  <p>Over time, organization/project starts seeing results of DevOps practices and embraces it fully.</p>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">5.What is a REST service?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>REST is also known as Representational State Transfer. A REST service is a simple software functionality that is available over HTTP protocol. It is a lightweight service that is widely available due to the popularity of HTTP protocol. </p>
  <p>Since REST is lightweight; it has very good performance in a software system. It is also one of the foundations for creating highly scalable systems that provide a service to large number of clients.</p> 
  <p>Another key feature of a REST service is that as long as the interface is kept same, we can change the underlying implementation. E.g. Clients of REST service can keep calling the same service while we change the implementation from php to Java.</p>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">6.What are the Three Ways of DevOps?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Three Ways of DevOps refers to three basic principles of DevOps culture. These are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>The First Way: Systems Thinking</b> : : In this principle we see the DevOps as a flow of work from left to right. This is the time taken from Code check in to the feature being released to End customer. In DevOps culture we try to identify the bottlenecks in this.</li>
        <li><b>The Second Way: Feedback Loops</b>: Whenever there is an issue in production it is a feedback about the whole development and deployment process.We try to make the feedback loop more efficient so that teams can get the feedback much faster. It is a way of catching defect much earlier in process than it being reported by customer.</li>
        <li><b>The Third Way: Continuous Learning</b>:: We make use of first and second way principles to keep on making improvements in the overall process.This is the third principle in which over the time we make the process and our operations highly efficient, automated and error free by continuously improving them </li>
    </ol>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">7.How do you apply DevOps principles to make system Secure?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Security of a system is one of the most important goals for an organization. We use following ways to apply DevOps to security.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Automated Security Testing</b>:We automate and integrate Security testing techniques for Software 
        Penetration testing and Fuzz testing in software development process.</li>
        <li><b>Early Security Checks </b>: We ensure that teams know about the security concerns at the beginning of a project, rather than at the end of delivery. It is achieved by conducting Security trainings and knowledge sharing sessions.</li>
        <li><b>Standard Process </b>: At DevOps we try to follow standard deployment and development process that has already gone through security audits. This helps in minimizing the introduction of any new security loopholes due to change in the standard process. </li>
    </ol>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">8.What is Self-testing Code?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Self-testing Code is an important feature of DevOps culture. In DevOps culture, development team members are expected to write self-testing code. It means we have to write code along with the tests that can test this code.Once the test passes, we feel confident to release the code. </p>
  <p>If we get an issue in production, we first write an automation test to validate that the issue happens in current release. Once the issue in release code is fixed, we run the same test to validate that the defect is not there. With each release we keep running these tests so that the issue does not appear anymore. </p>
  <p>One of the techniques of writing Self-testing code is Test Driven Development (TDD).</p> 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">9.What is a Deployment Pipeline? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
 <p>A Deployment Pipeline is an important concept in Continuous Delivery. In Deployment Pipeline we break the build process into distinct stages. In each stage we get the feedback to move onto the next stage.</p> 
 <p>It is a collaborative effort between various groups involved in delivering software development. Often the first stage in Deployment Pipeline is compiling the code and converting into binaries.</p> 
 <p>After that we run the automated tests. Depending on the scenario, there are stages like performance testing, security check, usability testing etc in a Deployment Pipeline. </p>
 <p>In DevOps, our aim is to automate all the stages of Deployment Pipeline. With a smooth running Deployment Pipeline, we can achieve the goal of Continuous Delivery.<p>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">10.What are the main features of Docker Hub?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Docker Hub provides following main features:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><b>Image Repositories</b>: In Docker Hub we can push, pull, find and manage Docker Images. It is a big library that has images from community, of icial 
     as well as private sources. </li>
     <li><b> Automated Builds </b>: We can use Docker Hub to create new images by making changes to source code repository of the image.</li> 
     <li><b>Webhooks </b>: With Webhooks in Docker Hub we can trigger actions that can create and build new images by pushing a change to repository. </li>
     <li><b>Github/Bitbucket integration </b>: Docker Hub also provides integration with Github and Bitbucket systems.</li>
    </ol>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">11.What are the security benefits of using Container based system?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
 <p>Some of the main security benefits of using a Container based system are as follows:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><b>Segregation </b>: In a Container based system we segregate the applications on dif erent containers. Each application may be running on same host but 
     in a separate container. Each application has access to ports, files and other resources that are provided to it by the container.</li>
    <li><b>Transient </b>: In a Container based system, each application is considered as a transient system. It is better than a static system that has fixed 
     environment which can be exposed overtime.</li>
    <li><b>Control </b>: We use repeatable scripts to create the containers. This provides us tight control over the software application that we want to deploy 
     and run. It also reduces the risk of unwanted changes in setup that can cause security loopholes.</li> 
    <li><b>Security Patch </b>: In a Container based system; we can deploy security patches on multiple containers in a uniform way. Also it is easier to patch a 
    Container with an application update.</li>
   </ol>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">12.How many heads can you create in a GIT repository?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
 <p>There can be any number of heads in a GIT repository.</p> 
 <p>By default there is one head known as HEAD in each repository in GIT</p> 


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">13.What is a Passive check in Nagios?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
 <p>In Nagios, we can monitor hosts and services by active checks. In addition, Nagios also supports Passive checks that are initiated by external applications.</p>
 <p>The results of Passive checks are submitted to Nagios. There are two main use cases of Passive checks:<p>
 <ol>
   <li> We use Passive checks to monitor asynchronous services that do not give positive result with Active checks at regular intervals of time.</li> 
   <li> We can use Passive checks to monitor services or applications that are located behind a firewal.</li>
 </ol>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">14.What is a Docker container?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
 <p>A Docker Container is a lightweight system that can be run on a Linux operating system or a virtual machine. It is a package of an application and related dependencies that can be run independently.</p> 
 <p>Since Docker Container is very lightweight, multiple containers can be run simultaneously on a single server or virtual machine.</p> 
 <p>With a Docker Container we can create an isolated system with restricted services and processes. A Container has private view of the operating system. It has its own process ID space, file system, and network interface.</p> 
 <p>Multiple Docker Containers can share same Kernel.</p> 


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">15. How will you remove an image from Docker? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
 <p>We can use docker rmi command to delete an image from our local system. 
    Exact command is:</p> 
 <p>% docker rmi <Image Id></p>  
 <p>If we want to find IDs of al the Docker images in our local system, we can user docker images command.</p>  
 <p>% docker images</p>
 <p>If we want to remove a docker container then we use docker rm command.</p> 
 <p>% docker rm<Container Id> </p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">16.What are the common use cases of Docker?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
   <p>Some of the common use cases of Docker are as follows:</p> 
     <ol>
      <li><b> Setting up Development Environment</b> : We can use Docker to set the development environment with the applications on which our code is dependent. 
      </li> 
      <li><b> Testing Automation Setup </b>: Docker can also help in creating the Testing Automation setup. We can setup different services and apps with Docker 
       to create the automation-testing environment. </li>
      <li><b> Production Deployment</b> : Docker also helps in implementing the Production deployment for an application.We can use it to create the exact 
       environment and process that wil be used for doing the production deployment. </li>
      </ol>
 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">17. Can we lose our data when a Docker Container exits? </a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
 <p>A Docker Container has its own file-system. In an application running on Docker Container we can write to this file-system.When the container exits, data written to file-system stil remains. When we restart the container, same data can be accessed again. </p>
 <p>Only when we delete the container, related data wil be deleted.</p>
 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">18. What is Docker?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Docker is Open Source software. It provides the automation of Linux application deployment in a software container. </p>
  <p>We can do operating system level virtualization on Linux with Docker.</p> 
  <p>Docker can package software in a complete file system that contains software code, runtime environment, system  tools, & libraries that are required to install and run the software on a server.</p> 
 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">19. What is the difference between Docker image and Docker container?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Docker container is simply an instance of Docker image.</p>
  <p>A Docker image is an immutable file, which is a snapshot of container. We create an image with build command. 
     When we use run command, an Image wil produce a container.</p> 
  <p>In programming language, an Image is a Class and a Container is an instance of the class.</p>
 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">20.How is a Docker container different from a hypervisor?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>In a Hypervisor environment we first create a Virtual Machine and then install an Operating System on it. After that we deploy the application. The virtual machine may also be installed on different hardware configurations.</p> 
  <p>In a Docker environment, we just deploy the application in Docker. There is no OS layer in this environment. We specify libraries, and rest of the kernel is provided by Docker engine.</p>
  <p>In a way, Docker container and hypervisor are complementary to each other.</p>
 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">21.Can we write compose file in json file instead of yaml?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Yes. Yaml format is a superset of json format. Therefore any json file is also a valid Yaml file</p>
  <p>If we use a json file then we have to specify in docker command that we are using a json file as follows:</p>
  <p>% docker-compose -f docker-compose.json up</p>
 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">22.Can we run multiple apps on one server with Docker?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Yes, theoretically we can run multiples apps on one Docker server. But in practice, it is better to run different components on separate containers</p>
  <p>With this we get cleaner environment and it can be used for multiple uses.</p>
 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">23.What are the main features of Docker-compose?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Some of the main features of Docker-compose are as follows</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Multiple environments on same Host</b>: We can use it to create multiple environments on the same host server.</li>
        <li><b>Preserve Volume Data on Container Creation</b>: Docker compose also preserves the volume data when we create a container.</li>
        <li><b>Recreate the changed Containers</b>: We can also use compose to recreate the changed containers.</li>
        <li><b>Variables in Compose file</b>: Docker compose also supports variables in compose file. In this way we can create variations of our containers.</li>
    </ol>
 
<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">24.What is the most popular use of Docker?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>The most popular use of Docker is in build pipeline. With the use of Docker it is much easier to automate the development to deployment process in build pipeline.</p>
<p>We use Docker for the complete build flow from development work, test run and deployment to production environment.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">25.What is the role of open source development in the popularity of Docker?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Since Linux was an open source operating system, it opened new opportunities for developers who want to contribute to open source systems.</p>
  <p>One of the very good outcomes of open source software is Docker. It has very powerful features.</p>
  <p>Docker has wide acceptance due to its usability as well as its open source approach of integrating with different systems.</p>
 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">26.What is the difference between Docker commands: up, run and start?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>We have up and start commands in docker-compose. The run command is in docker.</p>
  <li><b>Up</b>: We use this command to build, create, start or restart all the services in a docker-compose.yml file. It also attaches
  to containers for a service. This command can also start linked services</li>
  <li><b>Run</b>: We use this command for adhoc requests. It just starts the service that we specifically want to start. We generally

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">29.What is a Docker Image?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Docker Image is the blue print that is used to create a Docker Container. Whenever we want to run a container we have to
specify the image that we want to run.</p>
  <p>There are many Docker images available online for standard software. We can use these images directly from the source.</p>
  <p>The standard set of Docker Images is stored in Docker Hub Registry. We can download these from this location and use it in our environment</p>
  <p>We can also create our own Docker Image with the software that we want to run as a container.</p>
 
<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">30.What is a Docker Container?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>A Docker Container is a lightweight system that can be run on a Linux operating system or a virtual machine. It is a package of
 an application and related dependencies that can be run independently.</p>
 <p>Since Docker Container is very light weight, multiple containers can be run simultaneously on a single server or virtual machine.</p>
 <p>With a Docker Container we can create an isolated system with restricted services and processes. A Container has private view of the operating system. It has its own process ID space, file system, and network interface.</p>
 <p>Multiple Docker Containers can share same Kernel.</p>
 
<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">31.What is Docker Machine?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>We can use Docker Machine to install Docker Engine on virtual hosts. It also provides commands to manage virtual hosts.</p>
 <p>Some of the popular Docker machine commands enable us to start, stop, inspect and restart a managed host.</p>
 <p>Docker Machine provides a Command Line Interface (CLI), which is very useful in managing multiple hosts.</p>
 
<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">32.Why do we use Docker Machine?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
 <p>There are two main uses of Docker Machine:</p>
        <li><b>Old Desktop</b>: : If we have an old desktop and we want to run Docker then we use Docker Machine to run Docker. It is like installing a virtual machine on an old hardware system to run Docker engine.</li>
        <li><b>Remote Hosts</b>: Docker Machine is also used to provision Docker hosts on remote systems. By using Docker Machine you can install Docker Engine on remote hosts and configure clients on them.</li>

  <p>Three main steps of Docker Compose are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><b>Environment</b>: We first define the environment of our application with a Dockerfile. It can be used to recreate
    the environment at a later point of time.</li>
    <li><b>Services</b>: Then we define the services that make our app in docker-compose.yml. By using this file we
    can define how these services can be run together in an environment.</li>
    <li><b>Run</b>: The last step is to run the Docker Container. We use docker-compose up to start and run the
    application.</li>

  <p>Docker storage driver is by default based on a Linux file system. But Docker storage driver also has provision to plug in any other storage driver that canbe used for our environment.</p>
  <p> In Pluggable Storage Driver architecture, we can use multiple kinds of file systems in our Docker Container. In Docker info command we can see the Storage Driver that is set on a Docker daemon.</p>
  <p> We can even plug in shared storage systems with the Pluggable Storage Driver architecture.</p>

  <p>Docker based containers have folowing security concerns:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Kernel Sharing</b>: In a container-based system, multiple containers share same Kernel. If one container causes Kernel to go down, it wil take down al the containers. In a virtual machine environment we do not have this issue.</li>
        <li><b> Container Leakage </b> : If a malicious user gains access to one container, it can try to access the other containers on the same host. If a container has security vulnerabilities it can alow the user to access other containers on same host machine.</li>
        <li><b>Denial of Service</b>: If one container occupies the resources of a Kernel then other containers wil starve for resources. It can create a Denial of Service attack like situation</li>
        <li><b>Tampered Images </b>: Sometimes a container image can be tampered. This can lead to further security concerns. An attacker can try to run a tampered image to exploit the vulnerabilities in host machines and other containers.</li>
        <li><b>Secret Sharing</b> : Generaly one container can access other services. To access a service it requires a Key or Secret. A malicious user can gain access to this secret. Since multiple containers share the secret, it may lead to furthersecurity concerns</li>

  <p>Docker is a very powerful tool. Some ofthe main benefits of using Docker are as folows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Utilize Developer Skills</b> : With Docker we maximize the use of Developer skils. With Docker there is less need of build or release engineers. Same Developer can create software and wrap it in one single file.</li>
        <li><b>Standard Application Image</b> :Docker based system alows usto bundle the application software and Operating system files in a single Application Image that canbe deployed independently.</li>
        <li><b>Uniform deployment</b>: With Docker we can create one package of our software and deploy it on diferent platforms seamlessly</li>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">43. How does Docker simplify Software Development process?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Prior to Docker, Developers would develop software and pass it to QA for testing and then it is sent to Build & Release team for deployment.</p>
<p>In Docker workflow, Developer builds an Image after developing and testing the software. This Image is shipped to Registry. From Registry it is available for deployment to any system. The development process is simpler since steps for QA and Deployment etc take place before the Image is built. So Developer gets the feedback early.</p>
 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">44. What is the basic architecture behind Docker?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Docker is built on client server model. Docker server is used to run the images. We use Docker client to communicate with Docker server.</p>
<p>Clientstel Dockerserver via commands what to do.</p>
<p>Additionaly there is a Registry that stores Docker Images. Docker Server can directly contact Registry to download images.</p>

<p>Docker Command Line (DCL) tool is implemented in Go language. It can compile and run on most of the common operating systems. Some of the tasks that  we cando with Docker Command Line tool are as folows:</p>
 <ol>
<li> We can download images from Registry with DCL.</li>
<li> We can start, stop or terminate a container on a Docker server by DCL.</li>
<li> We can retrieve Docker Logs via DCL.</li>
<li>We can build a Container Image with DCL.</li>
</ol>
 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">46. What type of applications- Stateless or Stateful are more suitable for Docker Container?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>It is preferable to create Stateless application for Docker Container. We can create a container out of our application and take out the configurable state parameters from application. Now we can run same container in Production as wel as QA environments with diferent parameters. This helps in re using the same Image in diferent scenarios. Also a stateless application is much easier to scale with Docker Containers than a stateful application.</p>
 
<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">47. How can Docker run on different Linux distributions?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Docker directly works with Linux kernel level libraries. In every Linux distribution, the Kernel is same. Docker containers share same kernel as the host kernel.</p>
<p>Since al the distributions share the same Kernel, the container can run on any of these distributions.</p>
 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">48. Why do we use Docker on top of a virtual machine?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Generaly we use Docker on top of a virtual machine to ensure isolation of the application. On a virtual machine we can get the advantage of security provided by hypervisor. We can implement dif erent security levels on a virtual machine. And Docker can make use of this to run the application at diferent security levels.</p>
 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">49. How can Docker container share resources?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>We can run multiple Docker containers on same host. These containers can share Kernel resources. Each container runs on its own Operating System and it has its ownuser-space and libraries.</p>
<p>So in a way Docker container does not share resources within its own namespace. But the resources that are not in isolated namespace are shared between containers. These are the Kernel resources of host machine that have just one copy.</p>
<p>So in the back-end there is same set of resources that Docker Containers share.</p>

<p>Both Add and Copy commands of Docker file can copy new files from a source locationto a destination in Container’s file path. They behave almost same.</p>
<p>The main diference between these two is that Add command can also read the files from a URL.</p>
<p>As per Docker documentation, Copy command is preferable. Since Copy only supports copying local files to a Container, it is preferred over Add command.</p>

<p>We use Docker Entry point to set the starting point for a command in a Docker Image.</p>
<p>We can use the entry point as a command for running an Image in the container.</p>
<p>E.g. We can define folowing entry point in docker file and run it as folowing command:</p>
<p>ENTRYPOINT[“mycmd”]</p>
<p>% docker runmycmd</p>

<p>We use ONBUILD command in Docker to run the instructions that have to execute after the completion of current Docker  file build.</p>
<p>It is used to build a hierarchy of images that have to be build after the parent image is built.</p>
<p>A Docker build wil execute first ONBUILD command and then it wil execute any other command in Child Dockerfile.</p>
 

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">53. What is Build cache in Docker?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>When we build an Image, Docker wil process each line in Docker file. It wil execute the commands on each line in the order that is mentioned in the file.<p>
<p>But at each line, before running any command, Docker wil check if there is already an existing image in its cache that can be reused rather than creating a new image.<p>
<p>This method ofusing cache inDocker is caled Build cache in Docker.<p>
<p>We can also specify the option –no-cache=true to let Docker know that we do not want to use cache for Images. With this option, Docker will create al new images<p>

<p>Some ofthe common instructions in Docker file are as folows:</p>
 <li><b>FROM</b>: We use FROM to set the base image for subsequent instructions. In every valid Docker file, FROM is the first instruction.</li>
<li><b>LABEL</b>: We use LABEL to organize our images as per project, module, licensing etc. We can also use LABEL to help in automation. In LABEL we specify a key value pair that can be later used for programmaticaly handling the Dockerfile.</li>
<li><b>RUN</b>: We use RUN command to execute any instructions in a new layer on top of the current image. With each RUN command we add something on top ofthe image and use it in subsequent steps in Dockerfile.</li>
<li><b>CMD</b>: We use CMD command to provide default values of an executing container. In a Dockerfile, if we include multiple CMD commands, then only the last instruction is used.</li>

<p>We use EXPOSE command to in form Docker that Container wil listen on a specific network port during runtime.</p>
<p>But these ports on Container may not be accessible to the host. We can use –p to publish a range of ports from Container.</p>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">56. What are the different kinds of namespaces available in a Container?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>In a Container we have an isolated environment with namespace for each resource that a kernel provides. There are mainly six types of namespaces in a Container.</p>
<li><b>UTS Namespace</b>: UTS stands for Unix Timesharing System. In UTS namespace every container gets its own hostname and domain name.</li>
<li><b>Mount Namespace </b>: This namespace provides its own file system with in a container. With this namespace we get root like / in the file system on which rest of the file structure is based.</li>
<li><b>PID Namespace</b>: This namespace contains al the processes that run within a Container. We can run ps command to see the processes that are running with in a Docker container.</li>
<li><b>IPC Namespace</b>: IPC stands for Inter Process Communication. This namespace covers shared memory, semaphores, named pipes etc resourcesthat are shared by processes. The itemsin this namespace do not cross the container boundary.</li>
