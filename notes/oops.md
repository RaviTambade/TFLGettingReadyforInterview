<div class="entry-content">
<p>According to <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-other-frameworks-and-libraries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stackoverflow Survey 2023</a>, developers are using .NET and .NET Core in first place respectively, as framework or libraries. Mostly it is the first programming language the programmers learn after the OOPs concepts. There are multiple reasons for the success of .NET, one of the most prominent ones is its stack- layered architecture. This architecture provides flexibility to add/ update layers without disturbing the whole application.</p>
<p>.NET can be used to develop different types of high-performance applications such as gaming applications. It provides better monitoring, scalability, performance, and consistency for a whole range of applications such as console apps, GUI apps, web apps, web API apps, Windows services etc.</p>
<p>.NET MVC(Model-View-Controller), provides a large set of additional functionalities to create modular applications. It eases the whole application creation process by providing component-based development and testing.</p>

<section id="what-is-net-core-framework-and-how-does-it-work"><span style="color: #f66700;">1. What is .NET Core Framework, and how does it work?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>.NET Core framework provides an open-source, accessible, and general-purpose platform to create and run applications onto different operating systems. The framework follows the object-oriented programming principles that we can use C#, .NET, VB, Perl, Cobol, etc., programming languages. The framework provides various built-in tools such as packages, classes, libraries, APIs, and other functionalities. We can create a diverse range of applications.</p>
<h4>It works as follows:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Once you have finished developing codes for required applications, you need to compile those application codes to Common Intermediate Language.</li>
<li>The framework uses an assembly file to store the compiled code with an extension (.dll or .exe)</li>
<li>Now, the Common Language Runtime (CLR) of the framework convert the compiled code to machine code (executable code) using the Just In Time (JIT) compiler.</li>
<li>At last, we can execute this executable code on any specific architecture used by developers.</li>
</ul>

<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Since .NET Core is a modular platform thus, its components could be stacked into these three layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A .Net runtime: It consists of different runtime libraries that allow you to perform functions such as type safety, load assemblies, garbage collections etc.</li>
<li>A collection of Framework libraries: It also consists of libraries that offer utilities, primitive data types, etc.</li>
<li>A collection of SDK tools and compilers: It permits you to work with .NET Core SDK quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This stack could be divided into these four components:</p>

<section id="what-is-net-core-corefx"><span style="color: #f66700;">7. What is .NET Core CoreFX?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>CoreFX is the introductive class library for .NET Core. It consists of collection types, file systems, console, JSON, and XML for class library implementation. You can use this code as a single portable assembly. Since it provides platform-neutral code, thus you can share it across different platforms.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="8-What-is-CoreCLR"></span>
<section id="what-is-coreclr"><span style="color: #f66700;">8. What is CoreCLR?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>CoreCLR is the .NET execution engine in .NET Core. It consists of a garbage collector, JIT compiler, low-level classes, and primitive data types. Garbage collection and machine code compilation are its primary functions.</p>

<p>The following image shows .NET Core Compilation. You can clearly write codes in different languages that compliers like Roslyn would comply with. The compiler will generate the respective CIL code used by the JIT compiler for further compilation. Since CoreCLR is embedded in the JIT compiler, it would eventually generate machine code. Check its source code available on <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a></p>

<section id="how-is-net-core-sdk-different-from-net-core-runtime"><span style="color: #f66700;">9. How is .NET Core SDK different from .NET Core Runtime?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>.NET Core SDK builds applications, whereas .NET Core Runtime runs the application. Consider SDK is a collection of all tools and libraries you need to develop .NET Core applications quickly like a compiler, CLI. Consider Runtime as a virtual machine consisting of runtimes libraries and helps you run those applications.</p>

<section id="where-should-you-not-use-net-core"><span style="color: #f66700;">10. Where should you not use .NET Core?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Consider these <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cesardelatorre/net-core-1-0-net-framework-xamarin-the-whatand-when-to-use-it/#what-is-xamarin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">application areas</a> where you should prevent using .NET Core</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid using current .NET framework applications in productions or migration because there is a possibility when you are unable to execute third libraries from apps running on the .NET core. Although, these libraries are executable from the .NET framework.</li>
<li>Avoid using .NET Core in designing loosely coupled and new large monolithic applications. It is because of computability issues while consuming libraries with the .NET framework. You can create such applications by running on the top of the .NET framework and with the help of CLR libraries.</li>
<li>Any applications that need sub frameworks like WPF, WebForms, Winforms as .NET Core don't support these.</li>
<li>Prevent trying .NET Core in applications requiring higher level frameworks such as WCF, Entity Framework, and Windows Workflow Foundation.</li>
</ul>

<section id="what-are-the-advantages-of-net-core"><span style="color: #f66700;">11. What are the advantages of .NET Core?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Cross-platform development and deployment</b>: It can support application development on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, Mac, etc. Also, the deployment is supported on multiple platforms through containerization(Docker, Kubernetes, Service Fabric). This makes .NET completely portable and runnable on different platforms.</li>
<li><b>Open-source</b>: All .NET source code and documentation is freely available for download and contribution. This results in faster software releases, enormous support, and usage of the latest tools in development.</li>
<li><b>Supports a plethora of applications</b>: It has the capabilities to support a wide range of application types such as desktop, web, AI, cloud, mobile, IoT, gaming, etc.</li>
<li><b>Secure</b>: Provides easy-to-incorporate security measures like authentication, authorization, and data protection. It has mechanisms to protect the sensitive-data like keys, passwords, connection strings, etc. For e.g. in terms of authentication, <a href="https://asp.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASP.NET</a> Core Identity allows you to integrate your app with all major external providers.</li>
<li><b>High performance</b>: With every new release of the .NET core, the performance is improved for the benefit of users. For example, in .NET 5, the garbage collection is improved for faster speed, scalability, and reduction in memory resets’ cost. Detailed account of <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performance improvement in .NET 5.</a></li>
<li><b>Flexible</b>: Provides the flexibility to use any database and infrastructure as per choice. It provides the ability to change, evolve and grow easily according to external factors.</li>

<section id="what-do-you-know-about-net-core-middleware"><span style="color: #f66700;">12. What is Kestrel?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Kestrel is an event-driven, I/O-based, open-source, cross-platform, and asynchronous server which hosts .NET applications. It is provided as a default server for .NET Core therefore, it is compatible with all the platforms and their versions which .NET Core supports.</p>
<p>Usually, it is used as an edge-server, which means it is the server which faces the internet and handles HTTP web requests from clients directly. It is a listening server with a command-line interface.</p>

<h4>Advantages of Kestrel are:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight and fast.</li>
<li>Cross-platform and supports all versions of .NET Core.</li>
<li>Supports HTTPS.</li>
<li>Easy configuration</li>
</ul>

<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Middleware is a layer, software, or simple class through which all the requests and responses have to go through. The middleware is assembled of many delegates in an application pipeline. Each component(delegate) in the pipeline of the middleware decides :</p>
<ul>
<li>To pass the request to the next component.</li>
<li>Perform some processing on the request before or after passing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The below diagram shows a middleware request pipeline consisting of many delegates called one after another. Where black arrows mark the direction of execution. Each delegate in the diagram performs some operations before or after the next delegate.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="14-What-are-Razor-Pages-in-NET-Core"></span>
<section id="what-are-razor-pages-in-net-core"><span style="color: #f66700;">14. What are Razor Pages in .NET Core?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Razor Pages is a new server-side framework which works on a page-based approach to render applications in .NET Core. They are stored as a physical <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-5.0&amp;tabs=visual-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">.cshtml</a><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-5.0&amp;tabs=visual-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>file.</p>

<p>They have the HTML and code in a single file, without the need to maintain separate controllers, view models, action methods, etc. We can also have the code separate from the HTML in a different file which is attached to the Razor Page. Both types are shown below in the diagram:</p>
<p>Razor Pages framework is flexible, lightweight, cohesive, page-based, easy to learn and maintain compared to MVC. It can be used in conjunction with traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture or Web-API controllers.</p>

<section id="what-are-service-lifetimes-in-net-core"><span style="color: #f66700;">15. What are service lifetimes in .NET Core?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>.NET Core supports a design pattern called ‘<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#service-lifetimes">Dependency Injection</a>’ which helps in the implementation of IoC(<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/architectural-principles#dependency-inversion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inversion of Control</a>). During registration, dependencies require their lifetime to be defined. The lifetime of service decides under what condition the instance of the service will be created and till what time it will be live. </p>

<p>There are three types of service lifetimes supported by .NET Core:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Transient Service:</b> Instance is created each time it is requested.</li>
<li><b>Scoped Service:</b> User-specific instance is created once per user and shared across all the requests.</li>
<li><b>Singleton Service:</b> Single Instance is created once a lifetime of the application.</li>
</ul>

<section id="explain-docker-in-net-core"><span style="color: #f66700;">17. Explain Docker in .NET Core.</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It allows you to quickly isolate your applications from the infrastructure to transmit software. You should leverage this feature for managing infrastructure and deploying codes fast. It would help reduce the time needed between writing and running codes in infrastructure.</p>
<h4>Three main functions:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Quick and constant delivery of applications</li>
<li>Responsive deployment and scaling</li>
<li>Efficiently run more workloads on the same hardware</li>
</ul>

<h4>Take care following points while using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/docker/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker in .NET Core</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>You can use the Docker client's CLI for managing images and containers</li>
<li>You must adequately integrate Docker images, containers, and registries while designing and containerising applications or microservices</li>
<li>Use Dockerfile for rebuilding images and distribute them with others</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="18-What-is-NET-Core-CLI"></span>
<section id="what-is-net-core-cli"><span style="color: #f66700;">18. What is .NET Core CLI?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>.NET Core CLI is part of .NET SDK that provides a cross-platform toolset to develop, create, and run .NET Core applications. You can install multiple versions of the toolset on your machine. You can use the following standard syntax to use CLI:</p>
<p><i>dotnet [verb] [arguments]</i></p>
<h4>It provides four types of commands</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Basic commands</b>: All commands required to develop applications like new, restore, build, run, etc.</li>
<li><b>Project Modification commands</b>: It allows you to use existing packages or add packages for developing applications.</li>
<li><b>Advanced commands</b>: It gives various commands to perform additional functions such as deleting nuget.</li>
<li><b>Tool management commands</b>: You can use these commands to manage tools.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="19-What-is-Hosting-Environment-Management"></span>
<section id="what-is-hosting-environment-management"><span style="color: #f66700;">19. What is Hosting Environment Management?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>It is a new feature of .NET Core that permits you to work with multiple environments with no friction. You can use this feature through the available interface, Hosting Environment. The interface has been open since the first run of the application. Its execution depends on the environment variable and switch between the configuration files during runtime.</p>

<p>The interface reads a specific environment variable named "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT" and checks its value. Check its following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>If value</b>: Development – You are running the application in Dev mode</li>
<li><b>If value</b>: Staging – You are running the application in staging mode</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature permits you to manage the different environments as well.</p>

<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garbage collection</a> is another powerful feature of .NET Core. The primary function of this feature is to manage memory allocation and release. The .NET Core has "Zero Garbage Collector" to execute this function. You can call it Automatic Memory Manager.</p>
<h4>Benefits:</h4>
<ul>
<li>You don't need to put effort into releasing memory manually</li>
<li>Efficient object allocation on the heap</li>
<li>Ensure memory security by ensuring object's usage</li>
<li>You can reclaim objects that are no longer needed, free the memory, and use it for other purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Three conditions that allow garbage collection</h4>
<ul>
<li>The system has low physical memory</li>
<li>In case of an acceptable threshold</li>
<li>When the GC method has been called</li>
</ul>

<section id="discuss-cts-types-in-net-core"><span style="color: #f66700;">21. Discuss CTS types in .NET Core.</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/common-type-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Common Type System</a> or CTS standard defines and explains how to use data types in the .NET framework. The "System.Object" is the base type that derives other types in the singly rooted object hierarchy. It is a collection of data types, and Runtime uses it to implement cross-language integration.</p>
<h4>You can categorise this into two types:</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Value types:</b> This data type uses an object's actual value to represent any object. If you assign instance of value type to a variable, that variable is given a fresh copy of the value.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Examples:</b> Built-in value types, User-defined value types, Enumeration, Structure</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Reference types:</b> This data type uses a reference to the object's value to represent the objects. You can say it follows the concept of pointers. It doesn't create any copy if you assign a reference type to a variable that further points to original values.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Examples:</b> Self-defining types like array, Pointer type, Interface Type</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="22-Explain-CoreRT"></span>
<section id="explain-corert"><span style="color: #f66700;">22. Explain CoreRT.</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p><P>In .NET Core, CoreRT has been used as a native toolchain that performs compilation to translation. In other words, it compiles CIL byte code to machine code. The CoreRT uses ahead-of-complier, RyuJIT for compilation. You can also use it with other compilers to perform native compilation for UWP apps.</p>
<h4>As a developer, you can utilise its following benefits:</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is easy to work with one single file generated during compilation along with app, CoreRT, and managed dependencies.</li>
<li>It works fast because of the prior execution of compiled code. You don't need to generate machine code or load the JIT compiler at runtime.</li>
<li>Since it uses an optimised compiler, thus it generates faster output from higher quality code.</li>
</ul>

<section id="why-is-startup-class-important"><span style="color: #f66700;">23. Why is Startup Class important?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>The Startup is a critical class in the application. The following points make it imperative:</p>
<ul>
<li>It describes the pipeline of the web applications.</li>
<li>You can use individual startups for each environment.</li>
<li>It helps to perform the registration of all required middleware components.</li>
<li>Reading and checking thousands of lines in different environments is tough, but you can use various startup classes to resolve it.</li>
</ul>

<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Regarding .NET Core frameworks, state management is a kind of state control object to control the states of the object during different processes. Since stateless protocol, HTTP has been used, which is unable to retain user values; thus, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/app-state?view=aspnetcore-6.0#state-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different methods</a> have been used to store and preserve the user data between requests.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="25-What-is-the-best-way-to-manage-errors-in-NET-Core"></span>
<section id="what-is-the-best-way-to-manage-errors-in-net-core"><span style="color: #f66700;">25. What is the best way to manage errors in .NET Core?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>There are mainly four ways to manage errors in .NET Core for web APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Developer Exception Page</li>
<li>Exception Handler Page</li>
<li>Exception Handle Lambda</li>
<li>UseStatusCodePages</li>
</ul>
<p>But, in all these four, the best way is "Developer Exception Page" as it provides detailed information (stacks, query string parameters, headers, cookies) about unhandled request exceptions. You can easily enable this page by running your applications in the development environment. This page runs early in the middleware pipeline, so you can easily catch the exception in middleware.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="26-IS-MEF-still-available-in-NET-Core"></span>
<section id="is-mef-still-available-in-net-core"><span style="color: #f66700;">26. IS MEF still available in .NET Core?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Yes, MEF or Managed Extensibility Framework is still available. This library plays a major role in developing lightweight and extensible applications. You can easily use extensions without configuration. You can restore the extensions within and outside the application. You can smoothly perform code encapsulation and prevent fragile complex dependencies.</p>

<p>It has been considered outdated but is still available. If you want to use it, you must use it using some plugins systems and namespaces like "System.Composition", "System.ComponnetModel.Composition", and "Microsoft.Composition".</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="27-What-is-response-caching-in-NET-Core"></span>
<section id="what-is-response-caching-in-net-core"><span style="color: #f66700;">27. What is response caching in .NET Core?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>During response caching, cache-related headers are mentioned in the HTTP responses of .NET Core MVC actions. Using these headers, we can specify how the client/proxy machine will cache responses to requests. This, in turn, reduces the number of client/proxy requests to the web server because the responses are sent from the cache itself.</p>

<p>As we can see in the below diagram, the first request has a complete cycle from client browser to proxy server and then subsequently to web server. Now, the proxy server has stored the response in the cache. For all the subsequent requests, the proxy server sends the response from the cache itself. Hence, the number of proxy/client requests to the web server is reduced.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="28-What-is-a-generic-host-in-NET-Core"></span>
<section id="what-is-a-generic-host-in-net-core"><span style="color: #f66700;">28. What is a generic host in .NET Core?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>The generic host was previously present as ‘Web Host’, in .NET Core for web applications. Later, the ‘Web Host’ was deprecated and a generic host was introduced to cater to the web, Windows, Linux, and console applications.</p>

<p>Whenever a new application is started we are required to take care of the below points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency Injection</li>
<li>Configuration</li>
<li>Logging</li>
<li>Service lifetime management</li>
</ul>
<p>.NET generic host called ‘HostBuilder’ helps us to manage all the above tasks since it is built on the original abstraction of these tools.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="29-What-is-routing-in-NET-Core"></span>
<section id="what-is-routing-in-net-core"><span style="color: #f66700;">29. What is routing in .NET Core?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>It is a process through which the incoming requests are mapped to the corresponding controllers and actions.  The .NET Core MVC has a routing middleware to perform this task. This middleware matches the incoming HTTP requests to the executable request-handling code. We can define the routing in the middleware pipeline in the ‘Startup.Configure’ file.</p>

<p>As we can see in the below code snippet, there are two methods or pair of middleware to define routing:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>UseRouting:</b> Adds route which matches the middleware pipeline.</li>
<li><b>UseEndpoints:</b> Adds end execution point to the middleware pipeline and runs the delegate of the endpoint.</li>
</ul>
<div>

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env) 
    { 
        if (env.IsDevelopment()) 
        { 
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage(); 
        } 

        app.UseRouting(); 

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt; 
        { 
            endpoints.MapGet("/", async context =&gt; 
            { 
                await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World!"); 
            }); 
        }); 
    }

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="30-What-is-Dependency-Injection-in-NET-Core-Explain-its-advantages"></span>
<section id="what-is-dependency-injection-in-net-core"><span style="color: #f66700;">30. What is Dependency Injection in .NET Core? Explain its advantages.</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>.NET Core has been designed to support Dependency Injection(DI), which means the application is loosely coupled. It is a technique to introduce Inversion Control(IoC) between the classes and their dependencies. In other words, the object maintains only that dependency which is required during that particular task. A dependency is an object on which another object depends, by dependency injection, the application becomes better testable, maintainable, and reusable.</p>

<h4>Dependency Injection has three steps:</h4>
<ul>
<li>An interface or base class is present to provide an abstraction for dependency implementation.</li>
<li>Dependency is registered in a service container, a built-in container <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iserviceprovider?view=net-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IServiceProvider</a> is present in .NET Core.</li>
<li>Service is injected into the constructor of the class where dependency is used.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Advantages of Dependency Injection:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Code is flexible, implementation can be changed without much overhead.</li>
<li>Code becomes easy to test because of the use of interfaces.</li>
<li>Code is loosely coupled, clean, and easy to maintain.</li>
</ul>

<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>The application deployment process requires a windows server with an installed IIS manager. You need to use the IIS manager to perform deployment after the development of the applications. Without deployment, you can't bring any application to the market; thus, the IIS manager plays a primary role in completing this process. Click this <a href="https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/asp-net-mvc5-deployment-on-windows-iis-server/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> to know all steps of deployment using IIS manager.</p>

<p>Another deployment option is to use the Docker environment, which first deploys the docker package on any server machine and then implements the next deployment stage.</p>

<p>Roles define the permission to access something. A user can access any resource if they have permission. Role-based authentication is essential to ensure the security of applications and their data. It defines the role of providers and membership. The main task of providers is to give permission and assign roles to users to ensure authentication and authorisation.</p>

<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Check the following points to understand how ASP.NET is different from ASP.NET MVC:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET is a web platform, whereas ASP.NET MVC is an application framework for building web applications.</li>
<li>ASP.NET offers a layer that resides on the web server's top layer for creating web applications and services. Conversely, ASP.NET MVC framework stays on top of ASP.NET to design web applications with the help of ASP.NET's APIs.</li>
<li>ASP.NET is based on a simple event-driven programming model, whereas ASP.NET MVC is based on the "Model-View-Controller" architectural model.</li>
</ul>

<section id="asp-net-core-mvc-exposing-server-side-code-that-renders-html-elements"><span style="color: #f66700;">34. Which feature of ASP.NET Core MVC has been used as a new way of exposing server-side code that renders HTML elements?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>The new "Tag helper" feature of ASP.NET Core MVC helps expose server-side code that renders HTML elements. It brings the same features of "HTML Razor helpers, " which looks like standard HTML elements. There is no need to switch context between HTML and Razor Syntax. Tag helpers are objects, and you can bound them to the models and dynamically render HTML elements according to their properties. Some of the common Tag-helper objects are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>asp-action</b> – To use action methods</li>
<li><b>asp-for</b> – To use model binding</li>
<li><b>asp-route-id</b> – To use route expression</li>
<li><b>asp-validation-summary</b> – For validations</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a front-end designer working on CSS, JS frameworks or libraries, this feature can help you to quickly change or update the "View" without knowing the programming language. Additionally, they are reliable and reusable, which could be used in multiple views.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="35-What-is-the-view-component-feature"></span>
<section id="what-is-the-view-component-feature"><span style="color: #f66700;">35. What is the view component feature?</span></section>
<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>View Component is another new feature that has been considered a powerful version of partial views. It is used for solving many problems. The primary function of this feature is to split the complex views into reusable parts. With the help of partial views, you can also access the parent page's view model.</p>

<p>But, one drawback of this feature is that it can't access the page model and can operate on the passed arguments. Thus, the best application of this feature is to use it to render reusable pieces of pages that might consist of logic. Use this feature through dependency injection, which makes it robust and reusable.</p>

<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>MVC application life cycle has two stages of executing applications.</p>
<h4>First stage: Creating the request object</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fill the route table using route collection</li>
<li>Fetch the route to create "RouteData" object</li>
<li>Now use this object to create "RequestContext" object</li>
<li>At last, create a controller instance to control the class instance</li>
</ul>
<h4>Second stage: Creating the response object</h4>
<ul>
<li>Execute the action</li>
<li>Send the response to the browser as a result</li>
</ul>

<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>In ASP.NET MVC, controllers, controller actions, and action results are linked. You can consider that the action is a method on the controller which is called whenever someone requests URL in the browser address bar. The controller responds to the requests and also exposes controller actions. In simple, this action returns action results in different return types. Check this following table to know these return types, which inherit from the base Action Result class.</p>

<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>One of the essential concepts of ASP.NET MVC that help developers like me generate code to perform basic operations – Create, Read, Update, Delete. You can make changes in the codes as per needs. That's why, we call it a "code-generation framework" for developing MVC applications. It helps enhance the code which interacts with the data model of applications. It also supports reducing the development time to execute data operations.</p>

<p>Additionally, the framework includes multiple templates, including page templates, field templates, , entity page templates, and filter templates. You can call them Scaffold templates. These templates permit you to design and build a fully functional website.</p>

<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>The central role of Action Filters in ASP.NET MVC is the execution of filtering logic after an action method is called. You can call these filters to "custom attributes" which helps to clarify declarations of pre-action or post-action behaviour to the controller's action methods. These attributes are derived from the "System.Attribute" which could be attached to classes, methods, fields, or properties. You can utilise any of these filters to implement filtering.</p>

<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>An intercepting exception is an essential part of application development and execution. The exception handling's job is to respond to exceptional conditions. ASP.NET MVC has various ways to intercept exceptions, including</p>
<ul>
<li><b>HandleError attribute on controllers and action method</b> – A simple method to handle errors and exception</li>
<li><b>Try-catch-finally</b> – A simple three blocks to catch the exception</li>
<li><b>Overriding OnException Method</b> – A void method that takes an argument as an object of ExceptionContext to manage exception</li>
<li><b>Setting a goal exception handling filter</b> – You have to take care of HandleErrorAttribute and need to add it RegisterGlobalFilters</li>
<li><b>Extending HandleErrorAttribute</b> – It permits you to create your Exception Handler to manage the errors</li>
</ul>

<p>An MVC(Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern separates the application into three components and provides <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/architectural-principles#separation-of-concerns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separation of concerns.</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Model</b>: Represents the state of application/logic, where the business logic and implementation logic is encapsulated.</li>
<li><b>View</b>: It is responsible for providing the view through the user interface.</li>
<li><b>Controller</b>: Handles user interaction, works in tandem with model and view components.</li>
</ul>

<p>It provides the latest web standards and many features like routing, model binding, model validation, dependency injection, web APIs, razor view engine, filters, etc.</p>

<p>Any large ASP.NET MVC project has many controllers, views, and model classes. With time, it will become very difficult to manage it using the default MVC project structure.</p>

<p> The area is used to physically partition the large application into small functional units. Each unit has its own MVC folder structure and model, view, and controller folders.</p>

<p>The below example shows how each area - admin, finance, HR has its own set of model, view, and controller folders.</p>

<li><h2>What is the ASP.NET Core?</h2> 
<p><a href="https://www.dotnettricks.com/training/masters-program/aspnet-core">ASP.NET Core</a> is not an upgraded version of ASP.NET. ASP.NET Core is completely rewriting that work with the .net Core framework. It is much faster, configurable, modular, scalable, extensible, and has cross-platform support. It can work with both .NET Core and .net framework via the .NET standard framework. It is best suitable for developing cloud-based such as web applications, mobile applications, and IoT applications.</p><p>ASP.NET Core was primarily designed to make the most important part of the ASP.NET components under the concept learn and the compose framework where the previous ASP.NET&nbsp; components were released under a variety of different licenses periodically, The ASP.NET Core framework is a completely open-sourced framework. Apart from the other parts of the framework of the .NET framework libraries, the ASP.NET Core is primarily designed from scratch to be the platform-agnostic that performs seamlessly. It will allow the ASP.NET Core apps to be deployed on the various platforms or the o/s such as the macOS or Linux-based servers or certain devices.</p>
</li><li>
<h2>What are the features provided by ASP.NET Core?</h2>
<p>Following are the core features that are provided by the ASP.NET Core</p>
<ul class="unorderlist">
<li><p>Built-in supports for <a href="https://www.dotnettricks.com/learn/dependencyinjection">Dependency Injection</a></p>
</li><li><p>Built-in supports for the logging framework and it can be extensible</p>
</li><li><p>Introduced a new, fast and cross-platform web server - Kestrel. So, a web application can run without IIS, Apache, and Nginx.</p>
</li><li><p>Multiple hosting ways are supported</p>
</li><li><p>It supports modularity, so the developer needs to include the module required by the application. However, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dotnettricks.com/learn/netcore" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: inline !important;">.NET Core&nbsp;<span style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">framework is also providing the meta package that includes the libraries</span></a></p>
</li><li><p>Command-line supports to creating, building, and running of the application</p>
</li><li><p>There is no web.config file. We can store the custom configuration into an appsettings.json file</p>
</li><li><p>There is no Global.asax file. We can now register and use the services in the startup class</p>
</li><li><p>It has good support for asynchronous programming</p>
</li><li><p>Support WebSocket and SignalR</p>
</li><li><p>Provide protection against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>

<h2>What are the advantages of ASP.NET Core over ASP.NET?</h2>
<p>There are the following advantages of ASP.NET Core over ASP.NET :</p>
<ul class="unorderlist">
<li><p>It is cross-platform, so it can be run on Windows, Linux, and Mac.</p> 
</li><li><p>There is no dependency on framework installation because all the required dependencies are shipped with our application</p>
</li><li><p>ASP.NET Core can handle more requests than the ASP.NET</p>
</li><li><p>Multiple deployment options available withASP.NET Core</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>

<h2>What are Metapackages?</h2>
<p>The framework .NET Core 2.0 introduced Metapackage which includes all the supported packages by ASP.NET code with their dependencies into one package. It helps us to do fast development as we don't require to include the individual ASP.NET Core packages. The assembly Microsoft.AspNetCore.All is a meta package provided by ASP.NET core.</p><p>In other words, the Metapackages of .NET Core describes the set of packages that are used together and acts as a parent of the child grouping structure. The Metapackages are referenced just like any other NuGet package naming convention such as "NETStandard.Library". An by referencing the meta-package, you have, then all its child packages will be having the reference of its dependent packages accordingly.</p>
</li><li>
<h2>Can ASP.NET Core application work with full .NET 4.x Framework?</h2>
<p>Yes. ASP.NET core application works with full .NET framework via the .NET standard library.</p>
</li> <li> 
<h2>What is the startup class in ASP.NET core?</h2>
<p>The startup class is the entry point of the ASP.NET Core application. Every .NET Core application must have this class. This class contains the application configuration related items. It is not necessary that the class name must be "Startup", it can be anything, we can configure the startup class in the Program class.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> 
 public class Program
 {
 public static void Main(string[] args)
 {
 CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
 }
 
 public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;
 WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
 .UseStartup&lt;TestClass&gt;();
 }
</pre>
</li><li>
<h2>What is the use of the ConfigureServices method of the startup class?</h2>
<p>This is an optional method of startup class. It can be used to configure the services that are used by the application. This method calls first when the application is requested for the first time. Using this method, we can add the services to the DI container, so services are available as a dependency in the controller constructor.</p>
</li><li>
<h2>What is the use of the Configure method of the startup class?</h2>
<p>It defines how the application will respond to each HTTP request. We can configure the request pipeline by configuring the middleware. It accepts IApplicationBuilder as a parameter and also it has two optional parameters: IHostingEnvironment and ILoggerFactory. Using this method, we can configure built-in <a href="https://www.dotnettricks.com/learn/aspnetcore/middleware-custom-pipeline" target="_blank">middleware</a> such as routing, authentication, session, etc. as well as third-party middleware.</p>
</li><li>
<h2>What is middleware?</h2>
<p>It is software that is injected into the application pipeline to handle requests and responses. They are just like chained to each other and form as a pipeline. The incoming requests are passed through this pipeline where all middleware is configured, and middleware can perform some action on the request before passing it to the next middleware. Same as for the responses, they are also passing through the middleware but in reverse order.</p>
<div class="center">
 <img src="https://dotnettrickscloud.blob.core.windows.net/img/aspnetcore/aspnet-middleware.png" alt="middleware example"></div><div class="center">While working with the ASP.NET Core framework, there are tons of built-in Middleware components available that are already made available that we can use directly that act as a plug and play components. If we don't want to use any of the in-built middleware, then we can also create our own Middleware components in asp.net core applications whenever we want. The most important point that you need to keep in mind is, that in ASP.NET Core a given Middleware component should only have a specific purpose which means it should be used for a single responsibility.</div><div class="center">
 </div>
</li><li>
<h2>What is the difference between IApplicationBuilder.Use() and IApplicationBuilder.Run()?</h2>
<p>We can use both the methods in Configure methods of the startup class. Both are used to add middleware delegates to the application request pipeline. The middleware adds using IApplicationBuilder.Use may call the next middleware in the pipeline whereas the middleware adds using IApplicationBuilder.The run method never calls the subsequent middleware. After IApplicationBuilder.Run method, system stop adding middleware in the request pipeline.</p>
</li><li>
<h2>What is the use of the "Map" extension while adding middleware to the ASP.NET Core pipeline?</h2>
<p>It is used for branching the pipeline. It branches the ASP.NET Core pipeline based on request path matching. If the request path starts with the given path, middleware on to that branch will execute.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> 
 public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
 {
 app.Map("/path1", Middleware1);
 app.Map("/path2", Middleware2);
 }
</pre>
</li><li>
<h2>What is routing in ASP.NET Core?</h2> 
<p>Routing is functionality that map incoming request to the route handler. The route can have values (extract them from the URL) that are used to process the request. Using the route, routing can find a route handler based on the URL. All the routes are registered when the application is started. There are two types of <a href="https://www.dotnettricks.com/learn/aspnetcore/routing" target="_blank">routing</a> supported by ASP.NET Core</p>
<ul class="unorderlist">
<li><p>The conventional routing</p>
</li><li><p>Attribute routing</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The Routing uses routes to map incoming requests with the route handler and Generates URL that is used in response. Mostly, the application has a single collection of routes and this collection is used for the process of the request. The RouteAsync method is used to map incoming requests (that match the URL) with available in route collection.</p>
</li><li>
<h2>How to enable Session in ASP.NET Core?</h2>
<p>The middleware for the session is provided by the package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Session. To use the session in the ASP.NET Core application, we need to add this package to the csproj file and add the Session middleware to the ASP.NET Core request pipeline.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> 
 public class Startup
 {
 public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
 {
 ….
 ….
 services.AddSession();
 services.AddMvc();
 }
 public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
 {
 ….
 ….
 app.UseSession();
 ….
 ….
 }
 }
</pre>
</li><li>
<h2>What are the various JSON files available in ASP.NET Core?</h2>
<p>There are the following JSON files in ASP.NET Core :</p>
<ul class="unorderlist">
<li><p>global.json</p>
</li><li><p>launchsettings.json</p>
</li><li><p>appsettings.json</p>
</li><li><p>bundleconfig.json</p>
</li><li><p>bower.json</p>
</li><li><p>package.json</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<h2>What is tag helper in ASP.NET Core?</h2>
<p>It is a feature provided by the Razor view engine that enables us to write server-side code to create and render the HTML element in view (Razor). The tag-helper is a C# class that is used to generate the view by adding the HTML element. The functionality of the tag helper is very similar to the HTML helper of ASP.NET MVC.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html linenums"> Example:
 //HTML Helper
 @Html.TextBoxFor(model =&gt; model.FirstName, new { @class = "form-control", placeholder = "Enter Your First Name" }) 
 
 //content with tag helper
 &lt;input asp-for="FirstName" placeholder="Enter Your First Name" class="form-control" /&gt; 
 
 //Equivalent HTML
 &lt;input placeholder="Enter Your First Name" class="form-control" id="FirstName" name="FirstName" value="" type="text"&gt; 
</pre>
</li><li>
<h2>How to disable Tag Helper at the element level?</h2>
<p>We can disable Tag Helper at the element level using the opt-out character ("!"). This character must apply to open and close the Html tag.</p>
<b>Example</b> <pre class="prettyprint lang-html linenums"> &lt;!span asp-validation-for="phone" class="divPhone"&gt;&lt;/!span&gt;
</pre>
</li><li> 
<h2>What are Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core?</h2>
<p>This is a new feature introduced in ASP.NET Core 2.0. It follows a page-centric development model just like ASP.NET web forms. It supports all the features of ASP.NET Core.</p> 
<b>Example</b> <pre class="prettyprint lang-html linenums"> @page 
 &lt;h1&gt; Hello, Book Reader!&lt;/h1&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt; This is Razor Pages &lt;/h2&gt;
</pre>
<p>The Razor pages start with the @page directive. This directive handle request directly without passing through the controller. The Razor pages may have code behind files, but it is not really a code-behind file. It is a class inherited from PageModel class.</p>
</li><li> 
<h2>How can we do the automatic model binding in Razor pages?</h2>
<p>The Razor pages provide the option to bind property automatically when posting the data using the BindProperty attribute. By default, it only binds the properties only with non-GET verbs. we need to set SupportsGet property to true to bind a property on getting a request.</p>
<b>Example</b> <pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> public class Test1Model : PageModel
 {
 [BindProperty]
 public string Name { get; set; }
 }
</pre>
</li><li>
<h2>How can we inject the service dependency into the controller?</h2>
<p>There are three easy steps to add a custom service as a dependency on the controller.</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Create the service</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> public interface IHelloWorldService
 {
 string SaysHello();
 }
 
 public class HelloWorldService: IHelloWorldService
 {
 public string SaysHello()
 {
 return "Hello ";
 }
 }
</pre>
<p><b>Step 2: </b>Add this service to the Service container (service can either be added by singleton, transient, or scoped)</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
 {
 ….
 …
 services.AddTransient&lt;IHelloWorldService, HelloWorldService&gt;();
 …
 …
 }
</pre>
<p><b>Step 3: </b>Use this service as a dependency in the controller</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> public class HomeController: Controller
 {
 IHelloWorldService _helloWorldService;
 public HomeController(IHelloWorldService helloWorldService)
 {
 _helloWorldService = helloWorldService;
 }
 }
</pre>
</li><li>
<h2>How to specify the service life for a registered service that is added as a dependency?</h2>
<p>ASP.NET Core allows us to specify the lifetime for registered services. The service instance gets disposed of automatically based on a specified lifetime. So, we do not care about the cleaning these dependencies, it will take care of the ASP.NET Core framework. There are three types of lifetimes.</p>
<h3>Singleton</h3>
<p>ASP.NET Core will create and share a single instance of the service through the application life. The service can be added as a singleton using the AddSingleton method of IServiceCollection. ASP.NET Core creates a service instance at the time of registration and subsequence requests use this service instance. Here, we do not require to implement the Singleton design pattern and single instance maintained by the ASP.NET Core itself.</p>
<b>Example</b> <pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> services.AddSingleton&lt;IHelloWorldService, HelloWorldService&gt;();
</pre>
<h3>Transient</h3>
<p>ASP.NET Core will create and share an instance of the service every time to the application when we ask for it. The service can be added as Transient using the AddTransient method of IServiceCollection. This lifetime can be used in stateless service. It is a way to add lightweight service.</p>
<b>Example</b> <pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> services.AddTransient&lt;IHelloWorldService, HelloWorldService&gt;();
</pre>
<h3>Scoped</h3>
<p>ASP.NET Core will create and share an instance of the service per request to the application. It means that a single instance of service is available per request. It will create a new instance in the new request. The service can be added as scoped using an AddScoped method of IServiceCollection. We need to take care while the service registered via Scoped in middleware and inject the service in the Invoke or InvokeAsync methods. If we inject dependency via the constructor, it behaves like a singleton object.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums">services.AddScoped&lt;IHelloWorldService, HelloWorldService&gt;();
</pre>
