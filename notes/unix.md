<div class="entry-content">
<p>Know that computer scientists in Bell laboratories invented the Unix operating system in 1969. Unix is a family of computer operating systems. Unix is popular for its flexibility, portability, adaptability, interoperability, and many more. Not only limited to this, but you can also perform multiple operations since the Unix operating system is a multitasking and multiuser operating system.</p>
<p>If you go through all these Unix few interview questions, it will be beneficial to face your interviews with courage and confidence.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">1.How will you remove all files in current directory? Including the files that are two levels down in a sub-directory.</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
   <p>In Unix we have rm command to remove files and sub-directories. With rmcommand we have –r option that stands for recursive. The –r option can delete all files in a directory recursively.</p>
  <p>It means if we our current directory structure is as follows:</p>
  <p>My_dir</p>
  <p>->Level_1_dir</p>
  <p>> Level_1_dir ->Level_2_dir</p>
  <p>-> Level_1_dir->Level_2_dir->a.txt</p>
  <p>Withrm–r * commandwe candelete the file a.txt as wel as sub-directories Level_1_dir and Level_2_dir.</p>
  <p><b>Command:</b></p>
  <p>rm– r *</p>
  <p>The asterisk (*)is a wildcard character that stands for al the files with any name.</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 2.What is the difference between the –v and –x options in Bash shell scripts?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>In a BASH Unix shell we can specify the options –v and –x on top of a script as follows:</p>
  <p>#!/bin/bash -x –v</p>
  <p>With –x option BASH shell will echo the commands like for, select, case etc. after substituting the arguments and variables. So it will be an expanded form of the command that shows all the actions of the script. It is very useful for debugging a shel script.</p>
  <p>With –v option BASH shel will echo every command before substituting the values of arguments and variables. In –v option Unix wil print each line asit reads</p>
  <p>In –v option, If we run the script, the shel prints the entire file and then executes. If we run the script interactively, it shows each command after pressing enter</p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 3.What is a Filter in Unix command?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>

  <p>In Unix there are many Filter commands like- cat, awk, grep, head, tail cut etc.</p>
  <p>A Filter is a software programthat takes an input and produces an output, and it can be used in a stream operation</p>
  <p>E.g. cut -d :-f 2 /etc/passwd | grep abc</p>
  <p>We canmixand match multiple filtersto create a complex command that can solve a problem.</p>
  <p>Awk and Sed are complex filters that provide fuly programmable features.</p>
  <p>Even Data scientists use Unix filters to get the overview of data stored inthe files.</p>
    


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 4.What is Kernel in Unix operating system?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Kernel is the central core component of a Unix operating system(OS).</p>
  <p>A Kernel is the main component that can control everything with in Unix OS</p>
  <p>It is the first program that is loaded on startup of Unix OS. Once it is loaded it wil manage the rest of the startup process</p>
  <p>Kernel manages memory, scheduling as well as communication with peripherals like printers, keyboards etc.</p>
  <p>But Kernel does not directly interact with a user. For a new task, Kernel wil spawn a shel and user will work in a shel</p>
  <p>Kernel provides many system cals. A software programinteracts withKernelby usingsystemcals.</p>
  <p>Kernel has a protected memory area that cannot be overwrit tenaccidentaly by any process.</p>
    

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 5.What is a Shell in Unix OS</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Shel in Unix is a user interface that is used by a user to access Unix services.</p>
  <p>Generaly a Unix Shel is a command line interface (CLI) in which users enter commands by typing or uploading a file.</p>
  <p>We use a Shel to run diferent commands and programs on Unix operating system</p>
  <p>A Shel also has a command interpreter that can take our commands and send these to be executed by Unix operating system.</p>
  <p>Some ofthe popular Shels on Unix are:Korn shel, BASH, C shel etc.</p>
    

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 6.What are the different shells in Unix that you know about?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Unix has many flavors of Shel. Some of these are as folows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bourne shel: We use sh for Bourne shell</li>
        <li>Bourne Again shel: We use bash to run this shell </li>
        <li>Kornshel:We canuse kshto for Kornshell.</li>
        <li>Zshel:The command to use this is zsh</li>
        <li>C shel:We use cshto runC shel.</li>
        <li>EnhancedC shel:tcshisthe command for enhancedC shell</li>       
    </ol>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 7. What is the first character of the output in ls –l command ?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>We use ls -l command to list the files and directories in a directory. With -l option we get long listing format</p>
  <p>In this format the first character identifies the entry type. The entry type can be one of the folowing:</p>
  <p> b Block special file</p>
  <p>c Character special file</p>
  <p>d Directory</p>
  <p>l Symbolic link</p>
  <p>s Socket link</p>
  <p>p FIFO</p>
  <p>- Regular file</p>
  <p>Ingeneralwe see d for directoryand - for a regular file.</p>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 8.What is the difference between Multi-tasking and Multi-user environment?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>In a Multi-tasking environment,same user can submit more than one tasks and operating system wil execute the mat the same time.</p>
  <p>In a Multi-user environment, more than one user can interact with the operating systemat the same time.</p>
  <p>3. What is Command Substitution in Unix?</p>
  <p>Command substitution is a mechanism by which Shel passes the output of a command as an argument to another command. We can even use it to set a variable or use an argument list in a for loop</p>
  <p>E.g. rm`cat files_to_delete`</p>
  <p>In this example files_to_delete is a file containing the list of files to be deleted. cat command outputs this file and gives the output to rmcommand.rmcommand deletes the files.</p>
  <p>In general Command Substitution is represented by back quotes`</p>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 9.What is an Inode in Unix?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>An Inode is a Data Structure in Unix that denotes a file or a directory on file system. It contains information about file like- location of file on the disk, access mode, ownership, file type etc</p>
  <p>Each Inode has a number that is used inthe index table. Unix kernel uses Inode number to access the contents of an Inode.</p>
  <p>We can use ls-i command to get the inode number of a file</p>
    

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 10.What is the difference between absolute path and relative path in Unix file system?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Absolute path is the complete path of a file or directory from the root directory. In general root directory is represented by / symbol. If we are in a directory and want to knowthe absolute path, we canuse pwd command.</p>
  <p>Relative path is the path relative the current location in directory.</p>
  <p>E.g. In a directory structure /var/user/kevin/mail if we are in kevin directory then pwd command wil give absolute path as /var/user/kevin.</p>
  <p>Absolute path of mail folder is /var/user/kevin/mail. For mail folder./mail is the relative path of mail directory from kevin folder.
</p>
    



<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions">11.What are the main responsibilities of a Unix Shell?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Some of the main responsibilities of a Unix Shel are as folows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Program Execution: A shel is responsible for executing the commands and script files in Unix. User can either interactively enter the commands in Command Line Interface called terminal or they can run a script file containing a program.</li>
        <li>Environment Setup: A shel can define the environment for a user. We can set many environment variables in a shel and use the value of these variables in our program.</li>
        <li>Interpreter: A shel acts as an interpreter for our scripts. It has a built in programming language that can be used to implement the logic.</li>
        <li>Pipeline: A shel also can hookup a pipeline of commands. When we run multiple commands separated by | pipe character, the shel takes the output of a command and passes it to next one inthe pipeline.</li>
        <li>I/O Redirection: Shel is also responsible for taking input from command line interface (CLI) and sending the output back to CLI. We use >, <,>> charactersforthis purpose</li>        
    </ol>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 12.What is a Shell variable?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>A Unix Shel variable is an internal variable that a shel maintains. It is local to that Shell. It is not made available to the parent shell or child shell.</p>
  <p>We generalyuse lower case namesforshel variables in C shel.</p>
  <p>We can set the value of a shel variable by set command.</p>
  <p>E.g. % set max_threads=10</p>
  <p>To delete a Shel variable we can use unset command</p>
  <p>To use a Shel variable in a script we use $ sign in front of the variable name</p>
  <p>E.g. echo $max_threads</p>
    


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 13.What are the important Shell variables that are initialized on starting a Shell?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>There are folowing important Shel variables that are automaticaly initialized when a Shel starts:</p>
  <p>user:</p>
  <p>term:</p>
  <p>home:</p>
  <p>path:</p>
  <p>These Shel variables take values fromenvironment variables.</p>
  <p>If we change the value of these Shel variables then the corresponding environment variable value is also changed</p>
    

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 14.How will you set the value of Environment variables in Unix?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>We can use 'setenv' command to set the value ofenvironment variables.</p>
  <p>E.g. % setenv [Name] [value]</p>
  <p>% setenv MAX_TIME10</p>
  <p>To print the value ofenvironment variable we canuse 'printenv' command</p>
  <p>E.g. % printenvMAX_TIME</p>
  <p>If we just use print env then it lists all the environment variables and their values.</p>
  <p>To unset or delete an environment variable we use unsetenv command.</p>
  <p>E.g. % unsetenv MAX_TIME</p>
  <p>To use an environment variable in a command we use the prefix $ with the name of variable</p>
  <p>What is the special rule about Shell and Environment variable in Bourne Shell?</p>
  <p>In Bourne Shell, there is not much difference between Shell variable and Environment variable.</p>
  <p>Once we start a Bourne Shel, it getsthe value ofenvironment variables and defines a corresponding Shell variable. From that time onwards the shell only refers to Shel variable. But if a change is made to a Shel variable, then we have to explicitly export it to environment so that other shell or child processes can use it.</p>
  <p>Also for Shell variables we use set and unset commands</p>
    

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 15.What is the difference between a System Call and a library function?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>System calls are low-level kernel cals. These are handled by the kernel. System calls are implemented in kernel of Unix. An application hasto execute special hardware and system dependent instruction to runa Systemcal.</p>
  <p>A library function is also a low level call but it is implemented in user space. A library call is a regular function call whose code resides in a shared library.</p>
    
<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 16.What are the networking commands in Unix that you have used?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Some of the popular networking commands in Unix that we use are as folows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>ping :</b>We use this command to test the reach ability of a host on an Internet Protocol(IP) network</li>
        <li><b>telnet :</b> This is another useful command to access another machine on the network. This is command uses Telnet protocol</li>
        <li><b>tracert :</b> This is short for Traceroute. It is a diagnostic command to display the route and transit delays of packets across Internet Protocol.</li>
        <li><b>ftp:</b>We use ftp commands to transfer files over the network. ftp uses File Transfer Protocol</li>
        <li><b>su :</b> This unix command is used to execute commands with the privileges of another user. It is also known as switch user, substitute user.</li>
        <li><b>ssh : </b>This is a secure command that is preferred over Telnet for connecting to another machine. It creates a secure channel over an unsecured network. It uses cryptographic protocolto make the communication secure.</li>        
    </ol>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 17. What is a Pipeline in Unix?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>A Pipeline in Unix is a chain of commands that are connected througha stream in such a way that output of one command becomes inputfor another command.</p>
  <p>E.g. ls –l | grep “abc” | wc –l</p>
  <p>In the above example we have created pipeline ofthree commandsls, grep and wc</p>
  <p>First ls –l command is executed and gives the list of files in a directory. Then grep command searches for any line with word “abc” in it. Finaly wc –l command countsthe number of lines that are returned by grep command.</p>
  <p>In general a Pipeline is uni-directional. The data flows from left to right direction.</p>
    

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 18.What is the use of tee command in Unix?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>We use tee command in a shell to read the input by user (standard input) and write it to screen (standard output) as well as to a file.</p>
  <p>We can use tee command to split the output of a program so that it is visible on command line interface (CLI) as well as stored on a file for later use.</p>
  <p>Syntax is tee [-a] [-i] [file]</p>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 19.How will you count the number of lines and words in a file in Unix?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>We can use wc (word count) command for counting the number of lines and words in a file. The wc command provides very good options for collecting statistics of a file. Some of these options are:</p>
   <p>l:This optio ngives line count</p>
   <p>m:This option gives character count</p>
   <p>c :This option gives byte count</p>
   <p>w:This option gives word count</p>
   <p>L:This option gives the length of the longest line</p>
   <p>In case we give more than one files as input to wc command then it gives statistics for individual files as well as the total statistics for all files.</p>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 20.What is Bash shell?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>Bash stands for Bourne Again Shell. It i sfree software written to replace Bourne shell.</p>
  <p>We can see following line in shell scripts for Bash shell.</p>
  <p>#!/bin/bash</p>
  <p>In Bash we use ~/.profile at login to set environment variables.</p>
  <p>In Bash we can execute commands in batch mode or concurrent mode.</p>
  <p>Inbatchmode commands are separated by semi colon.</p>
  <p>% command1; command2</p>
  <p>In concurrent mode we separate commands by & symbol.</p>
  <p> % command1 & command2</p>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 21. How will you search for a name in Unix files?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>The typical DevOps workflow in our organization is as follows:</p>
  <p>We can use grep command to search for a name or any text in a Unix file.</p>
  <p> Grep stands for Globaly search a Regular Expression and Print.</p>
  <p> Grep command can search for a text in one file as well as multiple files.</p>
  <p> We can also specify the text to be searched in regular expression pattern.</p>
  <p> % grep ^z *.txt </p>
  <p>Above command searches for lines starting with letter z in all the .txt files in current directory.</p>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 22. What are the popular options of grep command in Unix?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>In Unix, grep is one of the very useful commands. It provides many useful options. Some of the popular    options are:</p>
  <p>% grep -i :This option ignores case while doing search.</p>
  <p>% grep -x :This option is used to search exact word in a file.</p>
  <p>% grep -v:We use this option to find the lines that do not have the text we are searching.</p>
  <p>% grep -A10:This option displays 10 lines after the match is found.</p>
  <p>% grep -c:We can use it to count the number of matching lines.</p>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 23. What is the difference between whoami and who am i commands in Unix?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>

  <p>Both the commands whoami and who am i are used to get the user information in Unix</p>
  <p>When we login as root user on the network, then both whoami and who am i commands will show the user as root.</p>

  <p>Superuser is a special user account. It is used for Unix system administration. This user can access all files on the file system. Also Superuser can also run any command on a system.</p>
  <p>Generaly Superuser permission is given to root user.</p>
  <p>Most of the users work on their own user accounts. But when they need to run some additional commands, they can use su to switch to Superuser account.</p>
  <p>It is a best practice to not use Superuser account for regular operations.</p>

  <p>We can use ps command to check the status of a process in Unix. It is short for Process Status.</p>
  <p>On running ps command we get the list of processes that are executing in the Unix environment.</p>
  <p>Generaly we use ps -ef command. In this e stands for every process and f stands for full format.</p>
  <p>This command gives us id of the process. We canuse this id to kill the process.</p>

  <p>We generaly use cat command to display the contents of a file</p>
  <p>If a file is very big then the contents ofthe file wil not fit in screen, therefore screen will scroll forward and in the end we just see the last page of information from a file.</p>
  <p>With more command we can pause the scrolling of data from a file in display. If we use cat command with more then we just see the first page of a file first. On pressing enter button, more command will keep changing the page. In this way it is easier to view information in a file.</p>   
  <p>When using the cat command to display file contents, large data that does not fit on the screen would scroll of without pausing, therefore making it dificult to view. On the other hand, using the more command is more appropriate in such case because it wil display file contents one screen page at a time.</p>


<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ASPNET-MVC-interview-questions"></span><a href="#asp-net-mvc-interview-questions"> 27. What are the File modes in Unix?</a><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
  <p>In Unix, there are three main permissions for a File:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>r = It means a user can read the file</li>
        <li>w = It means that a user can write to this file</li>
        <li>x = It means the a user can execute a file like a shell script</li>
    </ol>
  <p>Further there are three permissionsets.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Owner:User who created the file</li>
        <li>Group:This applies to user of a group to which owner belongs</li>
        <li>Other:This is rest of the users in Unix system</li>
    </ol>
  <p>With the combination of these three sets permissions of file in Unix are specified.</p>
  <p>E.g. If a file has permissions -rwxr-xr-- , it means that owner has read, write, execute access. Group has read and execute access. Others have just read access. So the owner or admin has to specificaly grant access to Others to execute the file</p>

  <p>After writing a shell script we have to give it execute permission so that it can be run in Unix shell.</p>
  <p>We can use chmod command to change the permission of a file in Unix.In general we use chmod+x to give execute permission to users for executing the shell script.</p>
  <p>E.g. chmod+x abc.txt will give execute permission to users for executing the file abc.txt</p>   
  <p>With chmod command we can also specify to which user/group the permission should be granted. The options are:

  <p>We use chmod command to change the permissions of a file in Unix. In this command we can pass the file permissions in the form of a three-digit number</p>
  <p>In this number 755, first digit 7 is the permissions given to owner, second digit 5 is the permissions of group and third digit 5 is the permissions of all others.</p>
  <p>Also the numbers 7 and 5 are made from following rules:</p>   
  <p>4 = read permission</p>
  <p>2 = write permission</p>
  <p>1 = execute permission</p>
  <p>So 7 = 4 + 2 + 1 = Read + Write + Execute permission</p>
  <p>5 = 4 + 1 = Read + Execute permission</p>
  <p>In out example 755 means, owner has read, write and execute permissions. Group and others have read and execute permissions</p>

  <p>In Unix shell we can use symbol & to run a command in background.</p>
  <p>E.g. % ls -lrt &</p>
  <p>Once we use & option it runs the process in background and prints the process ID. We cannot down this process ID for using it in kil command.</p>   
  <p>We can also use ps -ef command to get the process ID of processes running in background.</p>
  <p>Once we know the process ID of a process we can kil it by folowing command:</p>

name.</p>
<p>E.g. alias c=’clear’</p>
<p>Withthis alias we just need to type c for runningclear command.</p>
<p>In bashwe store aliasin .bash_profile file.</p>

<p>A Unix Shell takes following main steps to process a command:<p>
<ol>
<li><b>I. Parse </b>: First step is to parse the command or set of commands given in a Command Line Interface (CLI). In this step multiple
consecutive spaces are replaced bysingle space. Multiple commandsthat are delimited bya symbol are divided intomultiple
individual actions.</li>
<li><b>II. Variable </b>: In next step Shell identifies the variables mentioned in commands. Generaly any word prefixed by $ sign is a variable.</li>
<li><b>III. CommandSubstitution</b>:In this step, Shell executesthe commandsthat are surrounded by back quotes and replaces that section
with the output from the command.</li>
<li><b>IV. Wild Card </b>: Once these steps are done, Shell replaces the Wild card characters like asterisk * with the relevant substitution.</li>
